A Rare Tiffany Building Owned by a Nonprofit May Be Sold
A granite-faced townhouse in Bostonâ€™s Back Bay neighborhood was designed more than 100 years ago by the artist Louis Comfort Tiffany and is seen today as the most comprehensive surviving example of his residential vision.Its pale facade, with mosaic panels set in limestone and a stained-glass window over copper-clad double doors, is one of only two exteriors known to have been designed by Tiffany and the only one that remains intact.The interior, featuring an oval staircase and an entrance with white marble wainscoting and mosaic stair risers, is equally striking.For decades the building, known as the Ayer Mansion, has been owned by nonprofit organizations connected to the Roman Catholic group Opus Dei, and has functioned as part of a cultural center and a residence for women attending nearby colleges. During that time, its doors have periodically been opened to the public for tours, lectures and concerts.
