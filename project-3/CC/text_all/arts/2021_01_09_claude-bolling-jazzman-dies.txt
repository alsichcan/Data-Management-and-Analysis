Claude Bolling, Jazzman With Crossover Appeal, Dies at 90
Claude Bolling, a jazz pianist and composer with remarkable crossover appeal whose 1975 album, “Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano,” spent more than 10 years on the Billboard classical album chart, died on Dec. 29 in Garches, a suburb of Paris. He was 90.His death was announced on his website, which gave no further details.Mr. Bolling played and composed in a variety of styles — the Claude Bolling Big Band played regularly for years at the Méridien Etoile hotel in Paris — and wrote the scores for dozens of movies and television shows in both France and Hollywood. But “Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano,” written for and recorded with the famed classical flutist Jean-Pierre Rampal, elevated him to a new level of fame.Although the record drew criticism from both classical and jazz purists as, in the words of one article, “watered-down jazz with a thin classical veneer,” the listening public loved it. News accounts from the mid-1980s, noting that it was still on the charts after a decade, said that only the Pink Floyd album “The Dark Side of the Moon,” released in 1973, had achieved such longevity at that point. (“Dark Side” remained on the Top 200 album chart until 1988 and has periodically returned.)Mr. Bolling was inspired to pursue other crossover projects, including the 1980 album “Picnic Suite,” recorded with Mr. Rampal and the guitarist Alexandre Lagoya. An image on Mr. Bolling’s website shows the Billboard classical album chart from Sept. 4, 1982. “Suite for Flute and Jazz Piano,” in its 343rd week on the chart, sits at No. 5, with “Picnic Suite” at No. 22, his “Toot Suite for Trumpet and Jazz Piano” at No. 27, his “Concerto for Classical Guitar and Jazz Piano” at No. 30 and his “Original Boogie Woogie” at No. 39.
