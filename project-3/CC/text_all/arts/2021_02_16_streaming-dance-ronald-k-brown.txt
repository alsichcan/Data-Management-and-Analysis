Transcendent Spirits: Lift 40 Voices and Dance
Like dance and the other performing arts, choral singing has had a tough year. Singing is breath, breath carries germs, and these days large groups of people singing together is the stuff of nightmares. But the urge to raise voices in song together, like the urge to move to music, is powerful. Now, the New York Choral Society is combining the two — dance and song — in a new short film to be released on Feb. 23.The film, a setting of the hymn “God Is Seen,” will be available on the company’s website and YouTube page indefinitely. It is set to the sound of 40 unaccompanied voices, recorded individually, and then mixed using a software called Soundtrap. Like many old folk hymns, the earliest version of “God Is Seen” was based on an existing popular song, which provided its simple, hypnotic melody. The Choral Society sings a 1967 version by the American composer Alice Parker that has become a staple of the American choral repertory.The dance the Choral Society commissioned to accompany this piece is a duet, by Claudia Schreier. It, too, was created remotely, with Schreier on FaceTime in one state while the dancers — Larissa Gerszke of Complexions Contemporary Ballet and Chalvar Monteiro of Alvin Ailey — rehearsed in New York. In the film, Gerszke and Monteiro dance in a church-turned-performance-space in Brooklyn, the Irondale, a spare, unencumbered room with light streaming in from above. “I wanted to keep it simple,” Schreier said in an interview, “as a way to honor the human voice and the human form. I love the idea of it being about the two things that don’t need any additional elements. They are the most natural way we exist.”
