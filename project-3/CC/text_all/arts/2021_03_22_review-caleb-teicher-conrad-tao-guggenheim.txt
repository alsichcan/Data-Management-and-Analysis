Review: At the Guggenheim, They Heart New York and Indoor Dance
Rocketing up through two and half octaves, the glissando that starts Gershwin’s “Rhapsody in Blue” is a siren cry, an announcement of joy and chutzpah that has also come to mean “I love New York City.” On Saturday night, when the pianist Conrad Tao played it in the rotunda of the Guggenheim Museum, the dancer Caleb Teicher ran in and gave Nathan Bugh, a fellow dancer, a big fat hug.This was funny and sweet — perfect, really, as an expression of the moment’s emotion. For there we were, a live audience, masked and carefully spaced on the rotunda’s spiral walkway, experiencing live performance indoors. Spring is here! The pandemic is over! Everybody embrace!That’s what it felt like for a moment, at least. The pandemic isn’t over, of course. And while this performance of Caleb Teicher & Co. inaugurated the in-person return of the Works & Process series — with more performances scheduled through June by companies who have rehearsed in bubble residencies upstate — all such arrangements are tentative. NY Pops Up performances of Teicher’s company, scheduled for the same day, were canceled because of new protocols. And indoor performances scheduled this week at the Park Avenue Armory have been postponed because some cast members tested positive for Covid-19.
