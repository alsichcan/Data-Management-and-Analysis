The Inauguration Kept Crowds Out and Tried to Bring America In
Inauguration Day 2017 was notable, in part, for who wasn’t there: There were vast empty spaces on the National Mall, which the Trump Administration would soon deny in the opening shot of its four-year war on truth.The inauguration of President Biden was also defined by absences. But this time they were intentional, and — for better or worse — they were the point.Because of the pandemic, the inaugural’s organizers asked the crowds to stay away, replacing them with symbols that stood in for the Americans who were staying at home, as well as the more than 400,000 Covid-19 victims who were no longer with us.And because of the riot two weeks ago, by a mob the previous president incited, and the lingering threats from violent pro-Trump extremists, the ceremony made the Capitol steps feel like a fragile bubble of democracy, secured by a wide perimeter and thousands of troops.
