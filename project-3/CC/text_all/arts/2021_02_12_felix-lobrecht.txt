Bringing Some Cool to German Comedy
BERLIN — In a country where many comedians dress to play a character — a sleeveless pullover for a nerd, a pink tracksuit for a working-class housewife — Felix Lobrecht’s clothes are all his own.His gold chains, designer T-shirts and expensive sneakers make the 32-year-old standup look like a rapper, but his swagger onstage is no act. He’s just as confident without a microphone in hand.“I’m the first cool comedian in Germany,” Lobrecht said in a recent video interview.In the six years since he started doing standup, Lobrecht has become one of the most famous comedians in Germany by ignoring the comedy scene’s traditional gatekeepers and routes to success.He has amassed his own following through social media (with nearly 900,000 followers on Instagram) and a weekly podcast, which is the most popular in the German language (and the only non-English podcast to make it into Spotify’s worldwide top ten). Last year he won the German Comedy Prize, after it switched from a jury to a public vote, and when the dates for his first arena tour were announced, just before Germany went into lockdown last March, tickets sold out overnight.
