BAM’s 2021 Season Will Be Outdoors and Online
The Brooklyn Academy of Music’s 2021 season will feature a mix of outdoor performances and public art — including concerts played to individual audience members — as well as lectures and music delivered virtually, the organization announced on Thursday.While considerably scaled back from the Academy’s usual programming, the season will expand its footprint throughout Brooklyn. And it is one more addition to the growing slate of live arts events that are scheduled to gradually roll out across New York more than a year after the city was shut down by the coronavirus pandemic.In a news release, Academy officials said a large-scale public art installation, “Arrivals + Departures,” would grace the front of Brooklyn Borough Hall beginning Sunday.“Influences,” contemporary dance performed on ice skates, will come to the LeFrak Center at Lakeside in Prospect Park in April, and some of New York’s notable musicians will bring intimate “1:1 CONCERTS,” curated by Silkroad, to the Brooklyn Navy Yard starting in May. There will also be a Pop-Up Magazine event on the sidewalks of Fort Greene in June.
