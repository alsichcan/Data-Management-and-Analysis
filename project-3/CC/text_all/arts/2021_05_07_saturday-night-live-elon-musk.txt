‘Saturday Night Live’ Gets Ready for Elon Musk
When “Saturday Night Live” announced last month that this weekend’s broadcast would be hosted by Elon Musk, the billionaire chief executive of Tesla and founder of SpaceX, the decision was widely discussed, dissected and lamented.Musk’s fans celebrated the selection and praised “S.N.L.” for reaching outside its usual talent pool of actors, athletes and musicians.Professional comedians and television writers criticized the show for choosing a host with few cultural bona fides and a controversial history as a businessman.And in a digital sign of the times, some of “S.N.L.”’s own performers took to social media to express their displeasure (or, at least, their befuddlement) about Musk’s appearance on the show.
