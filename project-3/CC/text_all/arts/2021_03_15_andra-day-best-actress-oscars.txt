Andra Day Earns a Best Actress Nomination for ‘The United States vs. Billie Holiday’
Not even an Oscar nomination could curtail Andra Day’s productivity. The Junk Jedis had arrived to clean out her garage, and, well, Monday was as good as any.“I’m so sorry,” she said, as she hopped on a call to talk about her best actress nomination at the Academy Awards, while offering occasional direction to her garage-cleaning wizards. “I’ve still got a house to uphold and a family to take care of!”Just a few months ago, the 36-year-old star was still a relative unknown as an actress — her starring turn as the iconic singer in the Lee Daniels-directed biopic “The United States vs. Billie Holiday” (Hulu) was her first acting role in a major film. But she’s making a big impression: Last month, she became just the second Black woman to win best actress in a drama at the Golden Globes.And now, she and Viola Davis are the first pair of Black nominees in the best actress category at the Academy Awards since 1973, when Diana Ross was nominated for “Lady Sings the Blues” (in the same role Day plays) and Cicely Tyson was up for “Sounder.”
