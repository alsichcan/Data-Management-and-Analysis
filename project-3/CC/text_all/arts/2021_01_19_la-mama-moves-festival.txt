La MaMa Festival Is Still Moving, if Somewhat in Place
A new year is underway, and theaters remain closed in the United States. Vaccines are finally being distributed, but the virus is still spreading. Facing this uncertain situation, many dance artists and dance presenters seem to be in a holding pattern — done with the makeshift projects of 2020 but unsure what, if anything, to try next.That might account for the provisional feel of this year’s La MaMa Moves! dance festival. Last year’s, scheduled for May, was canceled, but several of the artists have been invited to contribute to a virtual substitute, rotating programs and artist discussions streaming on the La MaMa website Tuesday and Wednesday and Jan. 26 and 27. Solos, short videos and works in process add up to a picture of the moment: not much that’s finished or substantial but with flashes of promise all around.Kevin Augustine’s “Body Concert,” up first, is in the work-in-progress camp. The artistic director of Lone Wolf Tribe, Augustine is a skilled puppeteer and a puppet maker. His latest project involves foam-rubber body parts — hands, legs, eyes, all skinless like flesh-baring anatomy models — which he manipulates in a black body suit and face-covering mask. Rather than presenting this project in video form, he gives us a kind “making of” advertisement for it.
