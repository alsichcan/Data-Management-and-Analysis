An Arts Patron Widens Her Reach With a Brooklyn Museum
When some collectors gather a critical mass of artworks, they decide to open a private museum to share their trove with the world.But Lonti Ebers, who established the nonprofit institution Amant, has a different agenda: sharing art, but not her own.Amant is scheduled to open the doors of a 21,000-square-foot, four-building campus in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, N.Y., on June 5. It features an on-site artist residency program as well as exhibition spaces that will be open to the public, at no cost.
