Museum of the Bible Returns Artifacts to Egypt
The Museum of the Bible in Washington, which has been bedeviled since its inception in 2017 by claims that it acquired thousands of biblical artifacts on the black market, has quietly repatriated 5,000 manuscripts and bits of papyrus to Egypt, which has long asserted the items were ferreted from the country in 2011 amid the upheavals of the Arab Spring.Steve Green, chairman of the Bible Museum and a co-founder of the multibillion-dollar Hobby Lobby chain, had hinted at the return in March when he said that “several thousand items that likely originated from Iraq and Egypt, but for which there was insufficient reliable provenance information, would be returned to their countries of origin.”The return is one of several instances in which the museum, under legal pressure, has been forced to repatriate antiquities lacking proper paperwork. Some 450 cuneiform tablets and 3,000 ancient seals known as bullae were sent back to Iraq in 2017, and Hobby Lobby paid $3 million in a settlement with the U.S. government.In 2018, the museum announced that experts had concluded that five of 16 fragments said to have been part of the Dead Sea Scrolls were forgeries and removed them from display. (In 2020, the museum’s entire collection of scrolls was found to be fake.) The U.S. government has also seized an item known as the “Gilgamesh Dream Tablet,” which contains part of the “Epic of Gilgamesh” and was on loan to the museum. The government says the item, which the Hobby Lobby bought at Christie’s in 2014 for $1.6 million, was taken illegally from Iraq.
