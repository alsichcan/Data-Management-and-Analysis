Aretha Franklin’s Estate Signs Tentative Deal Over Back Taxes Owed
The estate of Aretha Franklin has reached a deal with the Internal Revenue Service to pay off millions of dollars in federal income taxes that the singer owed during her life, resolving a major financial issue that has been hanging over the estate since Ms. Franklin died in 2018.Under the agreement, which must be approved by the judge overseeing Ms. Franklin’s probate case, the estate will set aside 45 percent of all revenue it receives from now on to pay off the tax liability that Ms. Franklin accrued from 2010 to 2017.An initial payment of $800,000 is to be made to the I.R.S. within five days of the deal’s approval by the judge, Jennifer S. Callaghan of Oakland County Probate Court in Michigan, according to the document submitted in court on Feb. 19. It was signed by the estate’s executor and lawyers for Ms. Franklin’s four sons, as well as by a legal officer at the I.R.S.The document reports the I.R.S.’s claim against the estate as totaling $7.8 million, but that figure apparently does not reflect about $3 million that the estate already declared that it paid at the end of 2018.
