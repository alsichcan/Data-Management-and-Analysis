Palace Intrigue at the Louvre, as a Paint Job Leads to a Lawsuit
PARIS — In the midst of a pandemic, with empty galleries, shuttered doors and plunging revenues, the Louvre faces new turbulence: a legal fight over the color of its walls.Stucco cream? Or warm terra cotta?Those are the hues of palace intrigue at the storied French museum, which is awaiting the imminent decision of President Emmanuel Macron about whether to appoint a new leader, or to extend a third term to its current president, Jean-Luc Martinez.Some freshly repainted walls in the museum are now at the center of a trans-Atlantic legal clash between the Louvre and the Cy Twombly Foundation in New York over extensive renovations in its Salle des Bronzes. That gallery, now empty of its Greek antiquities, boasts a monumental blue ceiling mural designed in 2010 by Twombly, the abstract American painter, who died in 2011, a year after he completed the work.A debate about the suitability of the new wall color — precisely “Marron Côte d’Azur,” a reddish and black shade — has been circulating in the French press in recent weeks. On Friday, Twombly Foundation lawyers filed a lawsuit in a Paris court, demanding to reverse the Louvre’s renovation — part of a makeover project in what were once royal chambers — and restore the Salle des Bronzes’s neutral walls. The foundation is claiming a violation of the French concept of “droit moral,” or moral right to protect the integrity of an art work.
