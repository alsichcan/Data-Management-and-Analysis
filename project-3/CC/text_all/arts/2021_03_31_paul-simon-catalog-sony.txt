Paul Simon Sells His Entire Songwriting Catalog to Sony
Paul Simon has sold his entire songwriting catalog — including classics like “Bridge Over Troubled Water,” “The Sound of Silence” and “Still Crazy After All These Years” — to Sony Music Publishing, in the latest blockbuster transaction in the music publishing business.In its announcement of the deal on Wednesday, Sony gave few details, other than it was acquiring the “complete collection” of Simon’s compositions, including his work with Simon and Garfunkel and his solo material.The database of BMI, the performing rights organization that Simon is affiliated with, lists more than 400 titles under his name.The deal covers the copyrights for songwriting, which are separate from those for recordings. Simon had full ownership of his catalog, and Sony purchased 100 percent of the rights to his songs. That means that any future earnings from those songs — including the income that would have previously gone to Simon as both songwriter and copyright owner — will go to Sony.
