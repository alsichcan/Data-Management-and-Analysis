For Mother’s Day, a Healing Meditation on Mortality

I spent the rest of the dream grieving, wandering the city lost and alone, until, as though my subconscious had tapped Christopher Nolan to direct this nightmare, I woke up once, then again, within the dream. Each time, I called a friend in a panic to tell her about my horrible nightmare only to hear her response: That was no dream.When I finally woke up for real, I was devastated. I called my mother — who was befuddled at my panic — just to hear her voice. An awful, though obvious, revelation occurred to me in that moment: With my father dead, whenever my mother dies, I will be an orphan. The depths of that terror seized me, shattering me from the inside out.It was around this time that I first watched the finale of the animated series “The Midnight Gospel,” which unexpectedly addressed my fear. I had never encountered such a loving, acute examination of living and death on TV — particularly the death of a parent. The episode might serve as a comfort for anyone who is grieving this Mother’s Day.
