Another Possible Aretha Franklin Will Surfaces in Estate Dispute
The estate of Aretha Franklin just got a bit more complicated.When the legendary singer died at 76 in 2018, her family assumed she had no will. Then, nine months later, a few handwritten documents, which may represent two or even three wills, were found in Franklin’s home, leading to a dispute among her four sons over how her estate should be run and its assets divided.Now, a detailed document has emerged that lawyers for two of Franklin’s sons say is a draft of yet another will, from Ms. Franklin’s final years. The papers, filed in a Michigan court this week, include an eight-page document, titled “The Will of Aretha Franklin” and apparently drawn up in 2018, along with another 23 pages that lay out the terms of a trust.Both are stamped “draft,” and neither document has her signature.According to the lawyers in their filing, Ms. Franklin had retained a Detroit lawyer, Henry M. Grix, to help with her estate planning. The filing includes correspondence from Mr. Grix, dated December 2017, in which he summarizes an estate plan for Ms. Franklin, asks her some questions and refers to earlier discussions between them. The filing includes further handwritten notes, said to be from Ms. Franklin, in which she lists family members and other lawyers, along with her properties.The filing, by lawyers for her sons Ted White Jr. and Clarence Franklin, says the documents show that Ms. Franklin had been in discussions with Mr. Grix “for over two years,” and that the correspondence included her initials. After Ms. Franklin “fell very ill,” they said, another lawyer informed Mr. Grix that she was unable to sign.
