Alexei Ratmansky: From Hibernation to Bubble Bernstein
A few weeks ago, a group of dancers was hard at work in a converted conference room at the Silver Bay YMCA, a conference center and retreat, on the shore of Lake George. Men were lifting each other into the air, women were spinning, or hopping on pointe as they traveled through space. None were wearing masks, and all looked to be in surprisingly good shape.At the front of the room, the choreographer Alexei Ratmansky moved around restlessly, peppering them with suggestions: “Slooooowly!” “Resist! Resist!” “Follow each other!” The dancers corrected course. You would never have guessed that neither Ratmansky nor the dancers had been inside a theater for nearly a year.The seven dancers, all from American Ballet Theater, were creating “Bernstein in a Bubble,” a new ballet set to Leonard Bernstein’s “Divertimento.” It will be Ratmansky’s first since last March, when his full-length “Of Love and Rage” premiered at the Segerstrom Center for the Arts in Costa Mesa, Calif. (“Bernstein” will be available on the New York City Center website, starting on March 23 as part of an all-Ratmansky program, presented by American Ballet Theater and City Center.)
