A New Arts Destination Near Marfa Quietly Takes Shape
Marfa, Texas, has long been an excursion for fans of the artist Donald Judd’s minimalism. The town is home to the Judd Foundation, which maintains Judd’s living and work spaces, and the Chinati Foundation, a museum created by the artist.But for the last year, Michael Phelan — a contemporary artist who has lived in Marfa full time since 2014 — has been quietly planning another destination within miles of both sites: Marfa Invitational, an interdisciplinary, year-round arts and cultural foundation, set on five acres of high desert. While it is expected to be completed this fall, people who attend his art fair (previously known as the Marfa Invitational) in April can tour an inaugural display by the artist JPW3 (J. Patrick Walsh) at the new site.Phelan has designed a pair of identical exhibition halls, made of pre-engineered steel, totaling 15,000 square feet — each with 150 feet of roll-up aluminum and glass doors for an open-air experience. The pieces of the building are being fabricated in El Paso and will be assembled and constructed in Marfa on the foundation’s site. While prescient, the plans were conceived pre-pandemic.The buildings will accommodate a variety of programming, like visual art and sculptural installations, as well as talks, performances, films and fashion shows.
