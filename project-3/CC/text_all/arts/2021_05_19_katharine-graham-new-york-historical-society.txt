This article is part of our latest special report on Museums, which focuses on reopening, reinvention and resilience.Giving a luxurious designer evening gown the central position in an exhibition about Katharine Graham, former chief executive of the Washington Post Company, may at first seem as logical as highlighting a pair of aviator glasses in a show about Gloria Steinem.
