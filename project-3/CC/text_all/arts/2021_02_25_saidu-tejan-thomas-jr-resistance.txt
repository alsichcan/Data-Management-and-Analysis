Saidu Tejan-Thomas Jr. and the Voices of ‘Resistance’
In late 2018, Saidu Tejan-Thomas Jr. (pronounced “sai-eed”) heard something he couldn’t get out of his head.He was at his job at Gimlet, the podcast production company, working on a show called “Conviction,” about a dogged private investigator in the Bronx. As one of the show’s producers, Tejan-Thomas edited tape and assisted with scripts, painstaking work that required sifting through dozens of hours of interviews each week. One interview jumped out at him: an encounter outside of a bodega with a group of Black and Latino men in their late teens and early 20s. The story the young men told was disturbing — a notorious cop had been terrorizing their neighborhood for years — but they were clamoring to tell it, talking over one another in a vibrant hash of emphatic vernacular.Tejan-Thomas, who is 28, knew that sound well. He’d hear it in the lobby of his apartment building in Flatbush, or at the train station on his way to work in Downtown Brooklyn. But he’d never heard it while at work. As a young audio journalist, he’d studied shows like “This American Life,” “Radiolab” and “TED Radio Hour,” series that he loved but featured few Black voices. Gimlet, too, the home of popular series like “StartUp” and “Reply All” (Spotify acquired the company in 2019), had mostly white hosts, including on “Conviction.” Listening to the teens at the bodega, it was as if previously distinct worlds — personal and professional, Black and predominantly white — had somehow collided.
