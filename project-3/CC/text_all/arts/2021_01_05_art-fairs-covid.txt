Art World Sets Plans for 2021 Fairs (in Pencil)
Thousands of well-heeled frequent fliers browsing around yet another exhibition center, in yet another country, eager to discover the art world’s next big thing …That was the fun of art fairs, the destination events that defined and fueled a global boom in recent years. In 2019, sales from the world’s art fairs reached an estimated $16.6 billion, with dealers relying on fairs to generate more than 40 percent of that year’s revenue, according to last year’s Art Basel & UBS Art Market Report.But the coronavirus pandemic stopped the art fair merry-go-round. Back in March, the Tefaf Maastricht fair in the Netherlands closed four days early when an exhibitor tested positive for the virus. After Tefaf’s closure, at least 25 participants and visitors reported having Covid-19 symptoms. Mass-attendance art fairs have been on hold ever since, replaced — with limited success — by less lucrative online equivalents.
