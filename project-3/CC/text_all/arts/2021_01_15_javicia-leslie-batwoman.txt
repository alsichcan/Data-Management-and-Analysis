Javicia Leslie on Becoming TV’s First Black Batwoman
Javicia Leslie was all dressed up with nowhere to go.Stuck under strict quarantine, she had spent a week without talking in person to anyone outside her Airbnb in Vancouver, British Columbia. She was there to finish shooting Season 2 of the CW series “Batwoman,” just back from a trip to Los Angeles to see her family for holidays. Now not even her hair and makeup people were allowed in.“It’s a good thing I’m so busy,” she said. “I don’t have time to be lonely.”Or drab. Leslie, 33, who will become the first Black actress to portray Batwoman onscreen when Season 2 of the series premieres Sunday, was lighting up the room she has called home since August, in a white off-the-shoulder top, quadruple-stacked earrings and a fierce shade of eye-popping pink lipstick.“I’ll be here until May,” she said. “But I got to see my family for two weeks, so now I feel like I can finish the last five months strong.”As she waits to resume shooting the final half of the new season of “Batwoman,” she has been getting through the dreary winter days by watching the FX drama “Pose” and by looking forward to spring, when her garden there blooms with tulips and huge sunflowers that are “like, eight feet tall.”
