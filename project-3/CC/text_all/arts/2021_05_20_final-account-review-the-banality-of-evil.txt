‘Final Account’ Review: The Banality of Evil

Heinrich Schulze, a former Wehrmacht fighter, shows Holland his family farm where a group of escapees from the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp once hid until they were “picked up.”By whom? Holland asks. And how did they know the prisoners were hiding there? Schulze answers after a pause: “Well, we discovered them and reported it.”
