5 Art Accounts to Follow on Instagram Now
My other great cultural love, alongside visual art, is comics. I think it’s because the form combines writing and pictures, the two media to which I’ve devoted my career. Whether it's a comic or just a meme, I find it immensely satisfying and kinetic when images and words are brought together in such a way to add up to something greater than the sum of those parts.That something is the theme of my picks this month. Each of these accounts brings text into the Instagram frame, albeit in very different ways. After years of scrolling in search of only pictures, it seems I’ve finally accepted that this social media platform has more creative possibility than I thought.
