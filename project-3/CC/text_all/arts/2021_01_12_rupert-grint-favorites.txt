Rupert Grint Sees a Stage Mother in His Daughter’s Future
Rupert Grint wasn’t too put out when, in March, the pandemic halted production on “Servant,” the M. Night Shyamalan psychological thriller about a couple who replace their dead baby with a doll.His partner, the actress Georgia Groome, was pregnant with their daughter, Wednesday, and the lockdown meant that Grint could savor the early months of her life in the sanctuary of their North London home. He could also purge his mind of the freakish, claustrophobic “Servant” world — a Philadelphia brownstone cluttered with baby paraphernalia, including, rather eerily, the same stroller they’d bought for Wednesday.“I guess it’s not the best show to be involved with when you become a father,” said Grint, who plays the doll-baby’s brash, hard-drinking uncle, Julian. “The set does have this kind of weird energy because the tragic event that has taken place does linger in the walls. I’d often feel a sense of relief when I snuck off.”Still, new fatherhood helped him to better understand the psychology of Dorothy (Lauren Ambrose), the show’s tormented mother, once he returned to set this fall.
