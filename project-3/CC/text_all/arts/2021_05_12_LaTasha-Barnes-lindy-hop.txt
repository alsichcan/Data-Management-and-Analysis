From the Lindy Hop to Hip-Hop in One Improvising Body
If you want to understand the connections between jazz dance and its progeny you could read a book or take a course. But how much more efficient and fun just to watch LaTasha Barnes do her thing.Barnes is a scholar of dance in the academic sense, recently credentialed with a master’s degree from New York University. But it’s her embodied knowledge that’s more rare and influential. A tough-to-beat champion in the club-derived form known as house, she has, without conceding that field, also become a leader in Lindy Hop, a form that despite being created by Black dancers has long suffered a deficit of Black practitioners.
