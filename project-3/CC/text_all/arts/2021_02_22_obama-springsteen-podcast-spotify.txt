Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen: The Latest Podcast Duo
Former President Barack Obama and Bruce Springsteen are liberal icons, vacationing friends and rhapsodists about the dreams and travails of everyday Americans.Now they are also podcast hosts.On Monday, Spotify released the first two episodes of “Renegades: Born in the USA,” featuring the 44th president and the singer of the anthemic hit name-checked in the show’s title. In “Renegades,” which will release six subsequent episodes weekly, the two men speak intimately and expansively on topics like race, fatherhood and the painful divisions that persist in American society.Drawn from a series of one-on-one conversations at Springsteen’s home studio in New Jersey from July to December, the show is a searching, high-minded discussion of life in the United States from two masters of the form.“In our own ways, Bruce and I have been on parallel journeys,” Obama says in the first episode. “We still share a fundamental belief in the American ideal. Not as an airbrushed, cheap fiction or an act of nostalgia that ignores all the ways that we’ve fallen short of that ideal. But as a compass for the hard work that lies before each of us as citizens.”
