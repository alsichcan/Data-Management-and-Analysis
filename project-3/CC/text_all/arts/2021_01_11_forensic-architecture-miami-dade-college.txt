What Did Museum Sign Up For: Exhibition or Investigation?
If one vital function of art is to shake things up, look no further than an exhibition last year at the Museum of Art and Design at Miami Dade College in Florida.It was the first survey in the United States of work by Forensic Architecture, a London-based research group known for using three-dimensional renderings of buildings and streetscapes to investigate potential human rights violations and other incidents.The group had examined, for example, the fatal shooting of a Palestinian teenager by an Israeli border guard, evidence of the Russian military presence in eastern Ukraine and U.S. drone strikes in Pakistan.Now, as part of the exhibition, Forensic Architecture planned to use the small museum as a staging area for an investigation of the nearby Homestead Emergency Care Shelter.
