Trevor Noah Loves Seeing Newsmax Shook
Welcome to Best of Late Night, a rundown of the previous night’s highlights that lets you sleep — and lets us get paid to watch comedy. We’re all stuck at home at the moment, so here are the 50 best movies on Netflix right now.Late-night hosts on Wednesday took up the case of Mike Lindell, the chief executive of MyPillow and a staunch Trump supporter, who has made baseless claims of widespread election fraud involving Dominion Voting Systems, a voting machine vendor. When he made those same accusations this week on Newsmax, the anchor Bob Sellers tried to shut the interview down and then walked off camera, as Lindell’s comments were a legal concern for the conservative news network.Trevor Noah explained that in January, “Dominion finally told Newsmax, ‘Yo, if you don’t get our name out of your mouth, we’re going to sue your channel 349 [expletive] network into oblivion.’ And based on what happened yesterday, when Lindell tried to go back on Newsmax, the network is taking that threat seriously.”
