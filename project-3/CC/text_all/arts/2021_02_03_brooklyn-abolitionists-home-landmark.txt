Home of Brooklyn Abolitionists Receives Landmark Status
After a 20-year effort by activists to save it from destruction, a rowhouse in Downtown Brooklyn received landmark status Tuesday for its connection to the antislavery movement of the 1800s.A unanimous vote by the Landmarks Preservation Commission has designated the house, at 227 Duffield Street, as historically important. The designation prevents demolition of or alterations to the structure without the commissionâ€™s approval.It was just such an attempt that got the campaign to save the property started. The city tried to use eminent domain laws to seize and bulldoze the property, as it did others nearby, to make space for a $15 million park. In recent years, as the neighborhood has chosen to embrace its place in history, the local community board has renamed the area Abolitionist Place Park, but the city has yet to recognize it.The city, for its part, seemed to have anticipated the ruling; renderings of the most recent plans for what it calls Willoughby Square Park include the 227 building. Park developers are now facing another roadblock; in January, the Public Design Commission tabled their proposal for a monument honoring Brooklyn abolitionists so that the artist could collect more input from the community.
