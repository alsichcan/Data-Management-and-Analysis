Review: ‘In Treatment’ Thinks You Could Use a Session, America
America, even more than usual, has some stuff it could stand to talk through. Take the pandemic and its attendant fear, grief, insecurity and isolation; add police killings, a racial justice reckoning and protest movements; toss on political strife and a violent attempt to overturn a democratic election; and, collectively, we could benefit from therapy.It is, in other words, a spot-on time for HBO to relaunch “In Treatment.”The 2008-10 run of the drama, based on the Israeli series “Be’ Tipul,” was a kind of research-and-development prototype for television. Before the rise of streaming TV, it experimented with a binge-like format; in four to five half-hour episodes a week, the therapist Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) would meet with different patients — whose treatment would unfold weekly over the season — each story line converging in Paul’s weekly wrestling sessions with his own counselor.It also returned TV to its theatrical roots. It was essentially a series of interconnected two-hander stage plays in which the only action was talk.But what talk it was. Unlike many subtext-heavy HBO shows, “In Treatment” relied on characters at least theoretically saying overtly what was on their minds. But there were volumes of nuance in the nonverbal cues, the teasing out of deceptions, the riverine routes that conversation takes to find its path. Each session was part ministration, part duel, part dance.
