Review: ‘It’s a Sin’ Tells the Stories That Were and Could Have Been
In 1999, Russell T Davies created “Queer as Folk,” his raw, exuberant British series about the lives and lusts of young gay men in Manchester. As you begin “It’s a Sin,” coming to HBO Max on Thursday, you might at first think he has made the same show all over again.In this five-part series, three men barely into adulthood leave home and end up flatmates in London, where they can chase their dreams, find their people and have the liberty to be, socially and sexually, themselves.The big difference between it and “Queer as Folk” is signaled by the date stamp opening the first episode: September 1981. The beautiful, hopeful neophytes of “It’s a Sin” are walking unawares into the beginning of the AIDS epidemic, which will claim many of the characters we meet and an unbearable number of others.But that first impression, that “It’s a Sin” might also be a kind of celebration of freedom and carnality, is not wrong either.
