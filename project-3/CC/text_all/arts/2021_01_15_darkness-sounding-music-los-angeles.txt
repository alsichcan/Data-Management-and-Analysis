Sincere, Outdoorsy, Trippy, a Music Festival Breathes Los Angeles
Answering the phone and having the person on the other end sing softly for 10 minutes, just for you. Another vocalist, this one stationed outside your house for a five-minute concert. A piano recital stretching from dawn to dusk.An hourlong piece built from field recordings of the wind roaring through bristlecone pines. A guided sound hike through the desert. A pair of homemade chimes, each traveling around Los Angeles, a duet across a city.Sweet, deeply sincere, outdoorsy, a little trippy — all in all, very Los Angeles: These are some of the performances that will unfold through Feb. 14 as part of Darkness Sounding, a solstice-inspired festival from the local ensemble Wild Up. Billed as “spaced out music during the shortest days of the year,” the event blends sophisticated music-making and Wild Up’s back-to-basics ethos.“So many of the trappings of new music are about cerebral concepts of form and timbre,” Christopher Rountree, the group’s founder, said in an interview. “We wanted to return to something of the body and for the body. Simple beauty and observing nature.”
