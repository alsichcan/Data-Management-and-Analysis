‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ Season 1, Episode 2 Recap: Freedom Isn’t Free
If you’ve encountered Captain America only in the Marvel movies, it may surprise you to learn that in the comic books, Steve Rogers isn’t the only person who has picked up the shield and called himself (or herself) “Captain America.” There have been dozens of reboots, retcons and alternate universes in Marvel Comics’ publishing history, and along the way over a dozen heroes have donned the red, white and blue. More often than not, the stories about these characters weigh one big issue: What does it take to symbolize an entire nation’s ideals?At the end of last week’s episode of “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier,” we got our first glimpse of John Walker, the man the U.S. military chose to replace Steve as Captain America. This week’s episode, “The Star-Spangled Man,” opens with Walker in his old high school locker room, waiting to go out onto the football field for an interview with “Good Morning America” meant to show the world why he’s the right Cap.But if Walker is wrestling with any doubts about whether he deserves to wear the costume, he doesn’t show it. He may hate the rah-rah promotional parts of the job, but as someone who won three Medals of Honor in his Army career, Walker is already acting as if he’s earned this.The Falcon and the Winter Soldier, on the other hand? They’re not so sure about him. When Walker says on “Good Morning America” that he never knew the old Captain America personally but that Steve “feels like a brother,” the comment gets deep under Bucky’s half-mechanical skin. He runs to Sam to chastise him for letting this happen by refusing to take up the shield.
