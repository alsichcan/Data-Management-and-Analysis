Bamboo Entwined With Moroccan Textiles
The Church of San Giorgio Maggiore is one of the architectural jewels of Venice. Designed by the Renaissance master Andrea Palladio, it sits prettily on the edge of an island opposite St. Mark’s Square.For the next six months, the gardens behind the church will host an edifice that could not be more of a contrast: a temporary structure made of bamboo and wrapped in handwoven Moroccan textile.The structure — known as the Majlis, an Arabic word that means communal gathering place — is one of the collateral (or sidebar) events of this year’s Venice Architecture Biennale. Presented by the Caravane Earth Foundation, a nonprofit established by Qatar’s former ambassador to Moscow, Fahad Bin Mohammed Al-Attiyah, it will serve as a forum for discussion in Venice and then reappear in Qatar, where it is to be reinstalled next year in time for the 2022 Football World Cup.The designer of the Majlis is Simón Vélez, a Colombian architect who has worked with bamboo all his life. Born in 1949, he drew international attention at the World Expo in Hanover in 2000 when he put up a vast pavilion made of Colombian bamboo. The pavilion, which drew more than six million visitors, was seen as an example of sustainable, zero-emission architecture.
