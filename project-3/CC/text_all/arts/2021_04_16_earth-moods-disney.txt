When TV Goes Right Past Meditative to Vegetative
“Earth Moods,” which landed on Disney+ on Friday, is a television show: five episodes, each 31 minutes long. So why does it look so much like a screensaver?There are no voices in “Earth Moods” because there are no people. Just the abstract beauty of nature — the streaks and whorls of green water and red earth, as the screen drifts from dunes to reef to river delta. (There is an urban episode, “Night Lights,” but the aerial photography elides the human occupants of cars and buildings.) The soundtrack soughs and swells in step with the slowly moving cameras, occasionally giving way to the music of wind, water and birdsong.Unlike a laptop or smart-TV screensaver, though, which appears unbidden, “Earth Moods” takes some effort — it doesn’t come to you, you need to go to it. And you need to have paid for a Disney+ subscription. It might not exist if it weren’t for the big tent of streaming video, but it’s still TV, even if it sits at the far edge, requiring participation but asking for only the tiniest bit of engagement. Gliding past creative, derivative and meditative, it arrives at vegetative — the couch potato’s final destination.You could, with justification, dismiss “Earth Moods” as an anomaly, an incidental bonus that Disney+ (via its National Geographic subsidiary) throws in for its more anxiety-ridden subscribers. It is that, but it’s also one of a relatively small collection of original series on the service — on the home page, it is currently featured two icons ahead of “The Falcon and the Winter Soldier.”
