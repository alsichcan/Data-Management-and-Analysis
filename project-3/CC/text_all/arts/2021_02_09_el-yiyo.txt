A Flamenco Dancer for the YouTube Generation
BADALONA, Spain — In a makeshift dance studio in an industrial warehouse one recent afternoon, the flamenco dancer Miguel Fernández Ribas, known as El Yiyo, was practicing his moves next to a pile of pink and orange synthetic blankets that his father sells at local street markets.He lives within walking distance of the warehouse, alongside relatives and friends who form part of the Roma community in Badalona, a city just north of Barcelona.Theirs is a gritty, working class-neighborhood, a far cry from the Teatro Real opera house in Madrid, where El Yiyo made his debut in November, performing with such energy that he broke the heel of his boot. Undaunted, he threw off his boots and finished the act barefoot.“It’s unlucky to snap off a heel, but I didn’t feel like it was a serious crisis, because improvising is what I’ve always done,” he said in an interview in Badalona.
