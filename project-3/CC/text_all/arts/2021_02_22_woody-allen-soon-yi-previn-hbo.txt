Woody Allen and Soon-Yi Previn Call HBO Docuseries a ‘Shoddy Hit Piece’
Shortly after the premiere of the first episode of “Allen v. Farrow,” an HBO documentary series that re-examines Dylan Farrow’s decades-old sexual abuse allegations against the filmmaker Woody Allen, her adoptive father, a spokesperson for Mr. Allen released a statement on Sunday night slamming the series, calling it a “shoddy hit piece.”Letty Aronson, Mr. Allen’s sister, sent the statement — attributed to a spokesperson — shortly after the first episode aired, on behalf of Mr. Allen and Soon-Yi Previn, the filmmaker’s wife and the adopted daughter of Mia Farrow. In 1992, Ms. Farrow, Mr. Allen’s longtime girlfriend, learned of the relationship between Mr. Allen and Ms. Previn when Ms. Previn was a first-year college student. That relationship is also the subject of scrutiny in the four-part docuseries.Neither Mr. Allen nor Ms. Previn participated in the series, but it does include audio excerpts from Mr. Allen’s recent memoir, “Apropos of Nothing.”“These documentarians had no interest in the truth,” the statement said. “Instead, they spent years surreptitiously collaborating with the Farrows and their enablers to put together a hatchet job riddled with falsehoods.”
