MF Doom Influenced Scores of Musicians. Hear 11 of Them.
Daniel Dumile, the reclusive musician who performed as the masked villain MF Doom, died on Oct. 31 at 49, though the news wasn’t revealed until New Year’s Eve. Dumile spent more than two decades as one of the most recognizable and beloved artists in underground hip-hop, a rapper known for his unexpected word choices and intricate stacks of rhymes.However, Dumile’s impact went far beyond his formidable microphone skills. Hiding his face behind a metal mask in public appearances — if showing up for them at all — he separated his words from his person, rare in a genre steeped in self-aggrandizement and diaristic writing. His loyalty to independent labels like Stones Throw, Rhymesayers, Lex, Nature Sounds and Epitaph cut a path across the music industry’s established machinery. His beatmaking was idiosyncratic, sampling ’80s quiet storm records instead of ’70s hard funk, and he played the MPC sampler in a way that revealed the seams. “Madvillainy,” his breakthrough 2004 collaboration with the producer Madlib as Madvillain, eschewed traditional songcraft for a psychedelic, dreamlike swirl of ideas.His influence is apparent in the output of musicians working contemporaneously over the past two decades — rappers, singers and producers both inside the hip-hop world and beyond it. Here are 11 examples of how Doom’s aesthetic choices seeped into the artistic impulses of multiple generations.
