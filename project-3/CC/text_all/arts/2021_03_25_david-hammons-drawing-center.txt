David Hammons, Body and Soul, at the Drawing Center
David Hammons has had an extraordinary career. Moving to Los Angeles from his native Illinois in 1963, when he was 20, he studied with the great Social Realist painter and illustrator Charles White and soon found his way to the middle of the burgeoning Black Arts Movement.Along with a handful of other young artists, he helped define what Black American art would be going forward. For him, it would be conceptual and incisive, a decades-long leveraging of symbols — fair or unfair, positive or pejorative, self-applied or externally imposed — of Black identity. He’s made sculptures out of chicken bones, originated a widely reproduced American flag in Pan-African colors and sold snowballs on the street. If there’s a line between art as activism and art for art’s sake, he’s walked it like a tightrope.His most famous series may be the body prints he started making in the late 1960s, inspired by Yves Klein and by other art students in Los Angeles. (Hammons took classes at Otis Art Institute and visited other local programs.) But where Klein and the other kids used paint, Hammons greased up his body — or, later, someone else’s — and sprinkled powdered graphite on the paper only after he’d made an impression. It was a formidable innovation. Instead of the vague, if graphic, smudges a painted body would produce, these soft-edged, X-ray-like images caught every last detail. They look less like ordinary art works than like the Shroud of Turin.
