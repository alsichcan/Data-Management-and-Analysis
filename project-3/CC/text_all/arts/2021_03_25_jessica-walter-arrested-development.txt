Why Jessica Walter’s Pictures Said a Thousand Words
“I won’t hear it, and I won’t respond to it.”If you know the line, you can hear it in your head. It’s Lucille Bluth, the terrifying wealthy matriarch played by Jessica Walter in “Arrested Development,” reacting to what she perceives to be a possible veiled criticism.It is also a reaction GIF — a snippet of soundless, captioned video — that has been shared countless times on social media to express contempt, dismissal and denial, borrowing the crisp assertiveness of the actress and the character.On Thursday afternoon, this GIF, among other Lucille Bluth classics, began to flood my Twitter feed, to mourn and lament the news that Walter had died at age 80.
