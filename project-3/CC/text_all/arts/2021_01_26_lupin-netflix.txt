The Musée d’Orsay and Stanley Kubrick: What ‘Lupin’ Is Made Of
Named after a character who does not even appear in it, the French show “Lupin” has seduced audiences with a stylish, light-footed combination of family drama, romance and high-stakes capers. At the center is the star Omar Sy (“The Intouchables”) as the affable trickster and heistmeister Assane Diop, whose role model is the fictional gentleman-thief Arsène Lupin — an iconic figure in France invented by the mystery writer Maurice Leblanc in 1905.As it turns out, one of the essential forces behind this very Gallic creation is British: the screenwriter George Kay (also one of the masterminds of “Criminal,” a Netflix series with four versions, each in a different country). When Kay joined the team, he had limited information. He knew that Sy was attached to the project and that the plot had to somehow incorporate Lupin. Exactly how this was to come together was up to him, as creator and showrunner. During a video call from his home in London, Kay shared the movies, songs and spaces that influenced him as he worked on the series.
