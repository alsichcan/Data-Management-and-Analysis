Morgan Wallen’s Small-Town Country Songs, Aimed at a Big Audience
Whiskey. Bourbon. Beer. Tequila. Pickup trucks. Bars with jukeboxes. Boots. Rivers. Starry skies. A small-town Southern drawl. And a lot of girls: in bars, in trucks, in boots, by rivers, under starry skies and very fond of a drawl. Morgan Wallen, born and raised in Sneedville in eastern Tennessee, the son of a Baptist pastor, determinedly checks off backcountry bona fides in nearly every one of the 30 songs (32 on a deluxe version) on his second album, “Dangerous: The Double Album.” In America’s rural-urban divide, there’s no question which side he’s on.Wallen’s small town is an idyllic fantasy, an escape to a rural Neverland. It’s a place of red-dirt roads and unlocked doors, a refuge from the pretensions and snobbery of cities, a home for simple pleasures like fishing, drinking and sex. That homey backwoods southland isn’t Wallen’s territory alone. He shares it with plenty of country hitmakers, notably the members of Florida Georgia Line, who have been Wallen’s boosters and guest singers and rely on many of the same collaborating songwriters.Wallen, 27, has staked out his small-town territory decisively and repeatedly. His first hit single — after he gained national visibility as a contestant on “The Voice” in 2014 — was “The Way I Talk” in 2016, which proclaimed, “I ain’t ashamed, matter of fact I’m damn proud/of the way I talk, y’all.”
