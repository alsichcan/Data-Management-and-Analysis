Review: Walking in Light on the High Line
First we saw them, bright loops of light, walking. Then as they approached, we heard: vocal harmonies holding, shifting, droning, keening; a shared sound of moving parts, in search of something but in no hurry to find it.So began Okwui Okpokwasili’s “On the way, undone,” a processional performance at the High Line. Okpokwasili and three colleagues (Mayfield Brooks, Anaïs Maviel and Samita Sinha) were the walking lights, outfitted in headdresses of illuminated coils that looked like abstracted models of the solar system worn as crowns. And these performers were the sound, their voices amplified by speakers they dragged behind them on wheels.The work is a homage and farewell to Simone Leigh’s “Brick House,” a giant bronze bust of a Black woman that has been installed on the High Line since 2019 and is leaving at the end of the month. But “Brick House” presides over 10th Avenue at 30th St. And we — the audience and the performers — were in the covered passageway between 14th and 15th streets. We had some distance to travel.
