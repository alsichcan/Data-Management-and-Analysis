Maine Officials Say Artist’s Estate Overpaid Lawyers by $3.7 Million
Robert Indiana and his artistic legacy have suffered many indignities since his death at 89 in his home in Maine in 2018.Had the artist, in fact, designed much of his last work, been paid the full royalties due from business partners or been properly cared for in his last days, living alone in a ramshackle house on the island of Vinalhaven?Those questions have been debated for years in Maine and New York courtrooms. Now, as perhaps a final indignity, the Maine attorney general’s office is saying the lawyers who charged $8.4 million to handle those legal matters, and others, for Indiana’s estate were significantly overpaid.The attorney general’s office filed papers in Knox County Probate Court this week demanding that the executor of Indiana’s estate, James W. Brannan, a Maine lawyer, put back into the estate nearly half the money, $3.7 million, that he had paid out to seven law firms.
