Bobby Shmurda Eligible for Release From Prison in February
The Brooklyn rapper Bobby Shmurda, whose quick rise in the music industry was cut short when he was arrested on gang conspiracy charges in 2014, will be eligible for release from prison next month, the New York State Department of Corrections said on Monday.Shmurda, 26, whose legal name is Ackquille Pollard, was sentenced in Oct. 2016 to seven years in prison after pleading guilty to conspiracy and weapons possession in connection with what prosecutors said was his leading role in the GS9 gang, an offshoot of the Crips, in the East Flatbush neighborhood of Brooklyn.Shmurda was denied parole in September, in part because of disciplinary actions taken against him while he was incarcerated, and he was ordered then to serve his maximum sentence, to Dec. 11, 2021. But after a review by the Department of Corrections, Shmurda’s credit for good institutional behavior was restored, making him eligible for conditional release as of Feb. 23, barring any further incidents, with the remainder of his sentence to be served on parole.“I’m glad he’s coming home,” said Alex Spiro, a lawyer who represented Shmurda in the criminal case.
