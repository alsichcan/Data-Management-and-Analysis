From Sadler’s Wells, a Sampler of British Dance
When one door closes, another opens. During the pandemic, that maxim has acquired a corollary for concert dance: When theater doors shut, digital portals proliferate. With Britain is in another lockdown, Sadler’s Wells Theater in London is shut to audiences, but its dance programming is now accessible on its website for free, at least in the form of a tasting menu, three hourlong shows called “Dancing Nation.”For London audiences, it’s partly a take-what-you-can-get substitute. But for the rest of the world, this is something we didn’t have before, certainly not in so convenient a package: an opportunity to sample British dance. And the selections, most filmed at the theater recently, are clearly designed as a sampler: big national institutions alongside upstarts, a range of styles, a geographical spread.“You don’t think of the U.K. as a dancing nation, but it is,” Alistair Spalding, the artistic director of Sadler’s Wells, says in the first episode. That statement is telling. These are shows that profess to believe in dance (and take pride in the local scene) but presume that audiences don’t — that they need to be sold.“Dancing Nation” is a collaboration with BBC Arts, and the programs have the feel of a BBC travel show. The veteran correspondent Brenda Emmanus hosts, introducing each piece with boosterish adjectives (“astonishing,” “groundbreaking”), brochure descriptions (“a powerful piece about a couple dealing with depression”) and instructions on how to react (“once seen, never forgotten”). After each dance, she continues the hand holding, repeating some of those elements, just in case.
