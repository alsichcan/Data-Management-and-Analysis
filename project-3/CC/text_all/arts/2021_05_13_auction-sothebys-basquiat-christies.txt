Basquiat and Other Artists of Color Lead a Swell of Auction Sales
Just as the art market withstood the trauma of the Sept. 11 attacks and the economic plunge of 2008, so did the purchasing of high-priced paintings prevail at Sotheby’s on Wednesday during the first live contemporary auction since the onset of the pandemic in March 2020.Somehow, whatever crises convulse the world, the wealthy continue to buy art.In a deliberately sparse salesroom in Manhattan, with auction specialists beamed in from London and Hong Kong on screens, business was strong at Sotheby’s, which raised a total of $218.3 million from 32 lots. Christie’s raised $210.5 million on Tuesday evening from 37 lots in a fully virtual sale.
