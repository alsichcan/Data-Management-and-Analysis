6 Design Books That Celebrate a World of Artifacts
This article is part of our latest Design special report, which is about expanding the possibilities of your home.Artisans and designers, including Japanese temple builders, female silversmiths and African-American midcentury modernists, are rescued from obscurity (or simply appreciated from afar) in six insightful new books.More than 1,000 lustrous Victorian vessels appear in “Majolica Mania: Transatlantic Pottery in England and the United States, 1850-1915” (Yale University Press, $300, 972 pp.), the catalog for a traveling exhibition opening this fall at the Bard Graduate Center in Manhattan and already online. Dozens of scholars contributed essays about ceramics makers, from central England’s venerable Wedgwood to Manhattan’s forgotten James Carr. The companies flooded international markets with wares known under the umbrella term “majolica.” The designs were as majestic as fountains and fireplaces covered in dragons, and as endearingly frivolous as boots for holding toothpicks and jugs portraying baseball players. The authors have tracked down urban and rural brick-walled ghosts of long-shuttered factories. The three-volume book also pays homage to reformers who campaigned for legislation to protect laborers, including children, exposed to toxic metallic ingredients needed to induce bright colors.
