His Books Inspired Lovestruck Teens to Put Locks on Bridges
MILAN — Those love locks affixed to the Pont des Arts in Paris, the Ponte Milvio in Rome and the Brooklyn Bridge in New York?Federico Moccia takes full responsibility.While there are other theories as to what first inspired the now-derided practice, his 2006 novel, “Ho Voglia di Te” (“I Want You” in English), is widely credited for starting it. In the book, two lovestruck characters secure a padlock to a streetlamp on Ponte Milvio and throw the key in the Tiber River, citing a “legend” that couples who do so “will never break up.”The idea came from a rite of passage Moccia, 57, saw when he was in the army. “We had these locks for our bags, and when their service was over, people would attach them to the barracks fence,” he said in a video interview in January. “I thought it would be nice to turn a military thing into its opposite — make love, not war.” He even takes credit for placing the first lock on Ponte Milvio, he said, “in case some nit-picker came to check if was true.”The book is the second in a trilogy of young adult Italian romance novels that have sold 10 million copies globally, but they are only now being published in English. Grand Central Publishing this week is releasing the first book as “One Step to You,” translated by Antony Shugaar, followed in October by “Two Chances With You” and “Three Times You” in 2022. (All three have been given new titles for the English translations.) Little Brown Young Readers, which, like Grand Central, is an imprint of Hachette, is cross-promoting the first two books. A Grand Central representative said the publisher’s interest was sparked by “the success of Italian novels in translations like those by Elena Ferrante” and by the Netflix series “Summertime,” loosely based on “One Step to You,” which began streaming last year.
