‘Her Prose Is Sometimes Poetry’: Why Margaret Jull Costa Loves Virginia Woolf
“She’s such a compassionate describer of her characters with all their flaws,” says the prolific translator, most recently of Júlio Dinis’s “An English Family” and (with Robin Patterson) Machado de Assis’s “Posthumous Memoirs of Brás Cubas.”What books are on your night stand?Well, none, since I never read in bed, but there’s always a pile next to my favorite chair. At the moment, this includes “Buddenbrooks,” which we’re reading with a group of friends, “Le Château de Ma Mère,” by Marcel Pagnol, which my husband and I are reading with our French tutor, a collection of novellas and short stories by the Portuguese writer Maria Judite de Carvalho, who I’m keen to translate more of. And Michael Gorra’s “Portrait of a Novel,” about the writing of “Portrait of a Lady” (possibly my favorite novel) which has been on my pile for far too long and should be read soon.What’s the last great book you read?“Mrs. Dalloway,” by Virginia Woolf. Her prose is sometimes poetry. Listen to this: “Fear no more says the heart, committing its burden to some sea, which sighs collectively for all sorrows, and renews, begins, collects, lets fall.” And she’s such a compassionate describer of her characters with all their flaws. I hadn’t read the novel for years, and it was such a joy to revisit and rediscover it.Are there any classic novels that you only recently read for the first time?Yes, “Adam Bede,” by George Eliot, which I loved. Fascinating characters and such insight into ordinary working lives. The character of Hetty and her search (or odyssey) for the father of her child is one of the most touching, most heart-wrenching things I have read. “The Mill on the Floss” is more famous, but I felt that “Adam Bede,” her first long novel, was actually better and more original.
