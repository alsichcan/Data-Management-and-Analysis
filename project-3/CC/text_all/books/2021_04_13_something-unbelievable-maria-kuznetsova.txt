And Now, a Case for the Ordinary
SOMETHING UNBELIEVABLEBy Maria KuznetsovaThings labored over — like friends’ babies or poems — often elicit white lies, but not in “Something Unbelievable,” by Maria Kuznetsova. The book’s two narrators don’t shy from brutal truths: One calls her own baby “a pink, hairless, rat-faced little gremlin with enormous ears that made her look like a lost little space alien.” In another instance, a love poem is ridiculed. Since nothing is so labored over as a novel itself, I’m keeping this in mind for the following book review: The heroines of “Something Unbelievable” want nothing short of honesty.The novel’s two narrators are Larissa and Natasha. Larissa, who is in her 80s, lives in Kyiv, Ukraine, where she has video calls with her granddaughter, her beloved Natasha, a 30-something new mother living in New Jersey with her husband and his best friend, their temporary houseguest. Natasha is, as Larissa puts it, “weary and ruined and sweat-covered”: Though her acting career has not quite panned out the way she planned, she continues to audition — mostly for roles as Russian prostitutes.
