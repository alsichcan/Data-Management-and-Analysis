Annette Gordon-Reed’s Surprising Recollections of Texas
ON JUNETEENTHBy Annette Gordon-ReedAlmost every memoir could fairly be subtitled “The Education of. …” Some explicitly embrace the formulation; “The Education of Henry Adams” is the second most influential memoir in American letters, after Benjamin Franklin’s autobiography. “On Juneteenth,” Annette Gordon-Reed’s insightful, often touching reflection on the Black experience in Texas, starting with her own, lands between these two: less arch than Adams, more historical than Franklin.Gordon-Reed’s historical emphasis, like Adams’s, is partly a professional matter. Adams was a distinguished historian at the beginning of the 20th century. Gordon-Reed has earned acclaim as one of the most important American historians of our time. Her 2008 “The Hemingses of Monticello” won a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award.Gordon-Reed’s education included an awakening to the complexity of human existence. Many people look to history for lessons applicable to the present; they seek a “usable past,” in the words of Van Wyck Brooks. The simpler the lessons — that is, the more reducible to adage or slogan — the more usable they are. But simplicity comes at a cost to historical accuracy. Historians recognize this; for them the appeal is in the complexity.Time and again in this slim volume, Gordon-Reed notes her discovery that the past is more complicated than she had imagined. For her, as for millions of Texas schoolchildren before and after, the required seventh-grade Texas history class served as an introduction to what it meant to be Texan. Other states teach their own histories, but not many take it as seriously as Texas does. It’s probably no accident that Texas history is taught to students at the same age that Catholic children are confirmed and Jewish kids bar- and bat-mitzvahed.
