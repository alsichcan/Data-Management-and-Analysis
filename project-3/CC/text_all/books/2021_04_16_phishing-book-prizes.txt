$40,000 Swindle Puts Spotlight on Literary Prize Scams
LONDON — The organizers of the Baillie Gifford Prize, a respected British award for nonfiction writing, woke up on Nov. 25 to an excited email signed by the author Craig Brown.“Words cannot even begin to describe how over the moon I am,” the email gushed.The night before, Brown had won the 2020 prize for “150 Glimpses of the Beatles” (titled “One Two Three Four: The Beatles in Time” in Britain), a witty retelling of the Liverpool band’s story.There was just one problem, the email said: “I’m currently experiencing a few hiccups with my bank and also with the pandemic.” Could the organizers transfer the 50,000 pounds prize money — about $69,000 — to a PayPal account? “If that’s OK?” the email added.The message was written with “tremendous confidence,” Toby Mundy, the prize’s executive director, said in a telephone interview. “There was a bit of ‘zhoosh’ about the sentences,” he added. But he smelled a rat, called Brown and discovered that the email was a scam.
