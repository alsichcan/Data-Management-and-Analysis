If You Lived Here, You’d Be Home Now — Sort Of
SUPER HOSTBy Kate RussoWe find ourselves in the first wave of pre-pandemic fiction. Here come the narratives full of indoor scenes, maskless interactions and group coughing fits. Kate Russo’s breezy debut, “Super Host,” is one such novel, written long before the words “super” and “host” had everyday epidemiological associations.But this story of middle-aged Bennett Driscoll, a washed-up artist forced to rent out his lavish London home (the shower “has two rainfall shower heads and enough room to conduct an orchestra”) to a series of hapless women, situates itself even further back in time. At its best, it’s reminiscent of the early-aughts romps done to great commercial effect by Nick Hornby and Plum Sykes, and even of the tidy plotting executed by the author’s father, Richard Russo.“Super Host” is set in a fairy tale of London, chock-a-block with meet-cutes and grocery store cashiers who offer to lend their copy of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream” to first-time customers. But Bennett’s own life is not quite so dreamy. His thinly sketched ex-wife, Eliza (she loved ultimatums), could no longer “stand still” with him and has run off to America, leaving Bennett to fend for himself and his teenage daughter, a St. Martin’s student who paints large-scale vaginas (not her own, much to our hero’s relief).[ Read an excerpt from “Super Host.” ]Bennett also used to paint nudes, which sold for healthy sums, but his career has gone downhill since his fruit period. Now he’s relocated himself to the garden studio, where he struggles for relevance, trying not to smother romantic and professional opportunities with desperation. One would think Russo’s empathy for a straight attractive white man with a newfound obsession with rap and an affinity for existential spirals would not work, but it’s one of the novel’s sweeter spots: “The older he gets, the more impossible it becomes to live in the present.”
