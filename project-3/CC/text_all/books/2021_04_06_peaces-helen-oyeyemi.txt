Helen Oyeyemi’s New Novel Is Not a Fairy Tale
PEACES By Helen OyeyemiThe fairy tale has seen its share of modern reinterpretations, from gender-bent and feminist retellings to postmodern experiments by writers like Angela Carter and Robert Coover, who tested the limits of familiar narratives, twisting their hidden joints and hinges into infinite variations on the theme. And if these authors pushed the form to its recombinatory, orgiastic extremes, it could also be argued that they mapped its terrain entirely. What more was there to do with the fairy tale now that it had been dismantled, rebuilt, inverted and put through a blender?Helen Oyeyemi, the award-winning British-Nigerian author of six previous novels, a pair of plays and a story collection, has made her reputation answering this question in new and unusual ways. In her hands, the realm of lore and the so-called “real world” exert a gravitational pull on each other, resulting in unexpected amalgamations of Bluebeard and Yoruban folk tales, Tinder and talking dolls, and complex, unconventional characters who tug the trajectory of recognizable tales out of the ruts and grooves of a well-traveled road.With her newest novel, Oyeyemi ventures away from these familiar shapes, though not from the playful reinvention of genres and tropes. “Peaces” takes place on the Lucky Day, an esoteric, ramshackle, Wes Anderson-esque train whose ontological status is perched partway between the abstraction of a thought-object and the undeniably concrete world of lettuces, cubicles, Go boards and onboard saunas. Though vast, possibly boundless and filled with a seemingly innumerable number of whimsical, fantastical cars, the train is also subject to real-world burdens, like the tremendous debt accrued by its renovation and maintenance. It holds at least five passengers: Otto and Xavier Shin, lovebirds newly joined by name (though not by matrimony) who have received this “non-honeymoon honeymoon” trip from a wealthy aunt; Ava Kapoor, the train’s reclusive owner; her lover, Allegra Yu; and a taciturn legal representative named Laura De Souza. In addition to the Lucky Day’s human cargo, there are not one but two pet mongooses on board.
