‘Love Made You Black’: Gazes of Desire and Despair in a New Novel
OPEN WATER By Caleb Azumah NelsonOnly great artists can craft novels from water.Family, grief, Blackness, Frank Ocean, hip-hop, dancing, growing up, breaking up, London, oppression, beef patties, basketball, diasporic trauma — for Caleb Azumah Nelson, it’s all water. The happy glide when it’s easy; the exhaustion of fighting against the current when it’s not. The threat of drowning always looming in the waves.And in this unforgettable debut, “Open Water,” all streams are interconnected; the Thames, somewhere in the Atlantic, meets the Mississippi, meets the Rio Grande, the Amazon, the Nile. Which is how a Black reviewer from the South Side of Chicago feels so deeply connected to the story of a Black man falling in love and making art in southeast London.The prologue captures a quiet moment when our protagonist — an unnamed, 20-something photographer narrating in the second person — and his girlfriend, an unnamed, 20-something dancer, are sitting in a barbershop gazing at each other, “with the same open-eyed wonder that keeps startling you at various intervals since you met. The two of you, like headphone wires tangling, caught up in this something.”Anyone who was ever a young person in love remembers this feeling, this constant startling, the disbelief, the anxiety when “you lost her gaze for a moment and your breath quickened, as when a dropped call across a distance gains unexpected gravity.” But then, just as quickly, the inevitable realization that love is complicated by contradictions: “You would soon learn that love made you worry, but it also made you beautiful.”
