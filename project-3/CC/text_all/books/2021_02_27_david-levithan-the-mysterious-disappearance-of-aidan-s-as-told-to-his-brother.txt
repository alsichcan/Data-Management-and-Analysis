Out of the Wardrobe
THE MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF AIDAN S. (AS TOLD TO HIS BROTHER)By David LevithanDavid Levithan novels existed when I was a teenager, but I didn’t begin reading them until I was an adult. There’s no way I would have been comfortable as a closeted 13-year-old in the South Bronx picking up “Boy Meets Boy.”Even at 23, while reading “Two Boys Kissing,” I removed the hardcover’s gorgeous jacket on a crowded subway because the cover showed, well, two boys kissing, and I still wasn’t ready to be cast under that rainbow-filtered spotlight.Now comes Levithan’s addictive middle grade debut, which my younger self not only would have been able to safely read anywhere, but also would have devoured.“The Mysterious Disappearance of Aidan S. (as Told to His Brother)” begins with 12-year-old Aidan going missing. Was he kidnapped? Did he run away? What’s the story?
