In ‘Who Is Maud Dixon?,’ a Dream Job Leads to a Twisty Nightmare
How dismaying would it be to get a dream job working for a famous writer, only to discover that her new novel in progress seemed off somehow — remote and uninspiring? This is what happens to Florence Darrow in Alexandra Andrews’s “Who Is Maud Dixon?,” and at first it throws Florence for a loop.But where there is disillusionment, there is opportunity. Florence, we have come to understand, is devious, amoral and skilled in the art of the improvisatory grift — in short, an excellent antiheroine for a book that explores theft in many forms, literary and otherwise. “I could write this,” Florence thinks of the offending manuscript, taking it upon herself to change little things here and there as she types up the author’s draft.“Who Is Maud Dixon?,” a buzzy first novel already bound for Hollywood, is about many things. It is about being young and awkward and indignant and resentful. It is about ambition, reinvention, writer’s block, the vagaries of literary reputation, the murkiness of fictional inspiration and the desire to grab life by the collar and shake it until the money starts to pour out.And like Patricia Highsmith’s “The Talented Mr. Ripley,” the book to which Andrews’s noisily begs to be compared, it is about the urge, when you feel saddled with an unfair or inconvenient existence, to travel abroad, dispose of your traveling companion and invent a new and better identity.
