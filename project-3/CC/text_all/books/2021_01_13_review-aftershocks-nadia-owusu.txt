In ‘Aftershocks,’ a Search for Home in a Life Around the World
In Toni Morrison’s “Song of Solomon,” the character Pilate Dead is missing a navel, making her an object of both suspicion and awe.She was, as she says in the book, “cut off from people early,” left without a trace of her physical connection to her mother. Pilate becomes a drifter, untethered to any one place, but her independence isn’t the same as freedom. As Nadia Owusu writes in “Aftershocks” — a gorgeous and unsettling memoir of Owusu’s own peripatetic childhood, along with the bewilderment and breakdown that came after — it’s only when Pilate learns about her family’s ancestral home in Virginia that she becomes free.“The idea of roots setting a person free is counterintuitive, but deracination from the past, from land, from family, from mothers, makes for an unstable present,” Owusu writes. Her book is an attempt to understand what it means to be rooted and rootless, to have not one mother but two: a birth mother who left the family when Owusu was barely a toddler, and a stepmother who could be possessive and cruel.Owusu’s birth mother was Armenian-American; her father was Ghanaian; her stepmother was from a small village near Mount Kilimanjaro. Owusu herself was born in Tanzania. Her father worked for a United Nations agency, and Owusu lived all over — Tanzania, England, Italy, Ethiopia, Uganda. She moved to New York at 18, and studied urban planning: “I was fascinated by place because no place had ever belonged to me.”
