What Is Amazon Doing to Our Country?
FULFILLMENTWinning and Losing in One-Click AmericaBy Alec MacGillisOver the past year, as Covid has decimated the social and economic fabric of the United States, one company has been recording staggering profits and market growth, along with a hiring spree of over a thousand workers a day: Amazon. If you are reading this review, you have definitely encountered an Amazon product in some form — whether a blue-and-white bubble-lined envelope sitting outside your door or a delivery from Whole Foods. Even if you’ve decided to boycott Amazon purchases, just by going on The Times’s website you will have used an Amazon product — The New York Times, along with sites like Netflix, Zoom and Twitter, is hosted on Amazon Web Services, the cloud computing division behind Amazon’s smiling consumer face.And chances are high that whatever the product inside the bubble envelope, the Whole Foods bag or the web page you loaded, the product brought you some temporary fulfillment.In Alec MacGillis’s urgent book, “Fulfillment: Winning and Losing in One-Click America,” true fulfillment is elusive in Amazon’s America. Through interviews, careful investigative reporting and vignettes from across the country, MacGillis deftly unravels the strong grip Amazon has on the United States, from the ground level — in the inhumane working conditions of the warehouse, in rural towns upended by deindustrialization and subject to the glint of Amazon’s economic promise — to the gilded halls of Washington, D.C., where Amazon’s lobbyists flock.
