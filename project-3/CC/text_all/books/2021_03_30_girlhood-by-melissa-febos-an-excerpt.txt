‘Girlhood,’ by Melissa Febos: An Excerpt
1. First, the knees. They meet the gravel, the street, the blunt hips of curbs. Pain is the bright light flashing, forgotten for Vega’s colors, then Halley’s Comet—a burning streak behind the clouds. Your father holds you up to the sky, tells you, Look. Tells you, Remember this. You, small animal in the pink dress from your abuela, dirty sneakers, bloody knees, looking up.2. The oven is eye level and your forearms striped with burns. A tally of each time you reach over your depth. Are you just a child, or already Einstein’s definition of insanity? You like to be marked. Your mother, though, wails when she drops a blueberry pie from that height, sinks into the gory glory of its mess just before your father leaves port again. Oh, to stripe the floor with your own scalding compote. You stay closed, you hot box, you little teapot. You fill, but never empty. You stay striped.3. They call it a faggot test. Do you know what a faggot is, or only that you are part boy? Rub the pencil’s pink end across the back of your hand until it erases you. The circle of boys claps when you draw blood. After school, your mother’s stricken face scares you, but later, you are glad she saw the peeled pink of it—saw that it was in you.[ Return to the review of “Girlhood.” ]4. Your best friend flowers your limbs with bruises—Indian sunburn, snake bite, monkey bite, her pale knuckles vised into your thigh. Her fingernails carve you, one time permanently. Only your body flinches. You know the need to engrave things. After baseball practice, still in cleats, when she presses her mouth against your neck under the mildewed blanket in your basement, you are sorry her hot mouth leaves no mark.
