Individual Consciousness, Lengthy Biographies and Other Letters to the Editor
To the Editor:In her review of Andrea Pitzer’s “Icebound: Shipwrecked at the Edge of the Word” (Jan. 10), Rachel Slade concludes by writing: “‘Icebound’ is a reminder that there was once a time when things were unknown. And when their ships bumped up against the edge of the Arctic, the Europeans gazed with horror and awe at the sparkling ice and wondered what Edens lay beyond, waiting to be discovered.”Discovered? Is that what “Icebound” and the history of human conquest of nature reveal? Or is it rather plundered and annihilated? Before this interpretation, we read that “the 16th-century Dutchmen didn’t hesitate to shoot, maim, club, collar and impale whatever they saw. ‘Slaughter emerged as the instinctive Dutch response to the Arctic landscape, a new theater that would see the same performance again and again with every European wave of arrivals,’ Pitzer notes.”But that was then, some still say, now we know a great deal more. What shall we then make of The Times Magazine’s section in the same week, “Witness to an Extinction,” by Sam Anderson? “Mass extinction is the ultimate crisis, doom of all dooms, the disaster toward which all other disasters flow,” Anderson writes. “What could humans do that would be worse than killing the life all around us, irreversibly, at scale?”We do know more now, but obviously not enough to know that we are inextricably enmeshed in a great web of life; killing swaths of our biosphere will in time kill perhaps all of it, all of us.
