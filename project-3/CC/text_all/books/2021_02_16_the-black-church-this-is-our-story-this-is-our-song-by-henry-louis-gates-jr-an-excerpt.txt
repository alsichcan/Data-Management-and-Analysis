‘The Black Church: This Is Our Story, This Is Our Song,’ by Henry Louis Gates Jr.: An Excerpt
The right to vote was still a far‑off dream for many African Americans in postwar America, especially in the former Confederate states of the Deep South. Jim Crow laws, poll taxes, literacy tests, and violent terror tactics blocked African Americans’ access to full citizenship, despite the guarantees of the Fifteenth and Nineteenth Amendments, which barred discrimination by race or sex in the right to vote.Black church leaders, as well as members of their congregations who joined the struggle for civil rights, often suffered a violent and unrepentant backlash. As a result, the Reverend Yolanda Pierce, dean of the Howard University School of Divinity explains, “There were plenty of Black churches that did not participate in the civil rights movement. They were afraid to be a part of it. They worried that their churches would be the next to be bombed. And so they refused to allow the leaders of the civil rights movement to even have services there.”The Reverend William J. Barber II, an NAACP activist and pastor of the Greenleaf Christian Church in Goldsboro, North Carolina, sympathizes with their concerns but still imagines the power of a unified Black Church. “I don’t do a lot of judging of that, because you would get your church blown up. You would get your head shot off. But I often wonder what could have been if there was full unity. If there was a complete engagement, a total commitment of every Black denomination, could we have gone much further?”[ Return to the review of “The Black Church.” ]“Again, it’s about terrorism coming at Black people as a whole,” states the social critic and Harvard University professor Cornel West. “And when the Black Church at its best is the public face of the witness of love and justice, it will be targeted.”
