‘King Richard’ Finds Fresh Drama in Watergate
Before delving into Michael Dobbs’s rich and kaleidoscopic new book about Richard Nixon and Watergate, it’s worth thinking a bit about the miniature kaleidoscope contained in its title. There is the literal meaning of “King Richard” — the fact that Nixon’s mother named him after Richard the Lionheart, the 12th-century English king who spent most of his 10-year reign waging crusades in the Holy Land. And then there are the Shakespearean Richards: Richard II, who was forced to abdicate the throne; and Richard III, the murderous tyrant. Dobbs’s title also happens to echo the title of “King Lear,” Shakespeare’s tragedy about a monarch whose need for flattery invites treachery, precipitating his own downfall.Dobbs himself plays up this lugubrious element with the “American tragedy” in his subtitle and in the arc of the book itself, which is explicitly structured as a classical tragedy, he says, albeit with four acts instead of five. But in his wry and absorbing narrative I sensed an ironic dimension, too — a portrait of a petulant, insecure man who fancied himself king, or something like it; who told the British journalist David Frost: “When the president does it, that means that it is not illegal.” Garry Wills, in a 2017 preface to his 1970 classic, “Nixon Agonistes,” called him “the stuff of sad (almost heartbreaking) comedy,” whose “real tragedy is that he never had the stature to be a tragic hero.”Considering there hasn’t been a shortage of volumes about the 37th president, “King Richard” distinguishes itself in part by limiting its narrative mostly to the first hundred days after Nixon’s second inauguration, when the victorious president looked poised to coast through another four years before the wagons of the Watergate scandal started to circle closer and closer. An author whose previous subjects include the Cuban missile crisis and the collapse of the Soviet Union, Dobbs explains that he is fascinated by “hinge moments,” citing Barbara Tuchman’s preference for “history by the ounce” over “history in gallon jugs.”
