Ann Hood’s New Novel Plumbs Sibling Guilt and Sorrow
JUDE BANKS, SUPERHEROBy Ann HoodOver the course of her long career, the author Ann Hood (“The Obituary Writer,” “The Book That Matters Most”) has returned to themes of grief and loss again and again, not repetitively but in the sense of mining one vein for its richest stories. She has explored grief in fiction and memoir, in essays and even recipes, but never before in her work for younger readers.In “Jude Banks, Superhero,” we meet 12-year-old Jude, whose heart has been broken by the sudden death of his younger sister. Irrepressible Katie was brave and impulsive, theatrical and smart. Jude, not quite a year older, was content to live in her shadow, even when people looked right past him to say things about Katie like, “She’s going to take over the world someday, isn’t she?” Jude wasn’t jealous of his sister, he was proud. And then, in one terrible moment, Katie was gone.Now Jude is racked with secret guilt: For reasons that take some time to emerge, he truly believes her death is his fault.Back when Katie was alive, Jude would find things she’d lost and fix things she’d broken, and grateful Katie would say: “You, my brother, are a hero. … You’re a superhero.” Can he be a real one? Jude wonders. A caped crusader who saves others though he could not save his sister?
