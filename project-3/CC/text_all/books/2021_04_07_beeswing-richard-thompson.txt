Richard Thompson on Fairport Convention, Linda Thompson and London in the Late ’60s
BEESWINGLosing My Way and Finding My Voice, 1967-1975By Richard Thompson with Scott TimbergFolk music is a form of memory: Songs from other times and places summon our collective past. So it’s strange that Richard Thompson, known for updating British folk music in the 1960s, begins this memoir by resisting memory: “I don’t want to remember, but now it is time to think back. The arrow is arcing through the air and speeding towards its appointed target.”Thompson was born in London in 1949 and was playing guitar professionally by age 18. His early work — four years with Fairport Convention; 10 years with his first wife, Linda — has been gone over obsessively. The keening folk-rock he pioneered has been treated superbly in Joe Boyd’s “White Bicycles” (2006) and Rob Young’s “Electric Eden” (2010). The writing of this memoir was interrupted by the suicide of his co-author, Scott Timberg, in 2019. Yet “Beeswing” is wry, un-ponderous, anti-obligatory. Because the sound Thompson created with Fairport was rooted in centuries-old songs, he isn’t captive to ’60s clichés; and because British electric folk is off the classic-rock grid — as he ruefully observes, “The niche remained a niche” — the book’s period accent makes it feel fresh and exploratory.
