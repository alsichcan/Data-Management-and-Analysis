Beverly Cleary Wrote About Real Life, and Her Readers Loved Her for It
“Today the letters that fill an author’s mailbox often begin, ‘Our class is studying live authors,’” wrote Beverly Cleary in “Why Are Children Writing to Me Instead of Reading?,” an essay published in The New York Times Book Review in 1985. “Why only living authors, I wondered. Then I caught on that the answer was the expectation of a reply or what children refer to as ‘free stuff.’”The much-adored author of 42 books for children, who was declared a “Living Legend” by the Library of Congress in 2000, died on Thursday at the age of 104.To borrow a response from Cleary’s most famous character, Ramona Quimby: “Guts! Guts! Guts!” What else is there to say?Cleary’s novels — “The Mouse and the Motorcycle,” “Henry and Ribsy” and “Ralph S. Mouse,” just to name a few — are now in the hands of a third generation of readers. Her books are a cornerstone of modern children’s literature, front and center in the bedtime canon, and among the first that many young children enjoy on their own. She was the recipient of every accolade available to authors of books for young readers — from the Newbery Medal to the National Book Award — and will remain alive in the imagination of every child who met Ramona and Beezus Quimby, Henry Huggins, Otis Spofford, Ellen Tebbits or any one of her dear, flawed, funny characters, and thought: “That’s me.”
