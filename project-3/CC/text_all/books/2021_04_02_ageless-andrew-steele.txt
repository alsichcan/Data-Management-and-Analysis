Looking Forward to Your 170th Birthday
AGELESS The New Science of Getting Older Without Getting Old By Andrew SteeleAndrew Steele wants to make birthdays fun again. He knows that once we reach a certain age, most of us greet the turn of another year with at least a little dread. That’s because we assume that “getting older” inevitably means “getting old,” with all the increased frailty and diminished vitality we associate with advancing age. But getting on in years doesn’t have to mean becoming elderly, Steele argues — and in his new book, “Ageless,” he does a surprisingly effective job of decoupling the two.Steele is a science writer who, having earned a Ph.D. in physics, “decided that aging was the single most important scientific challenge of our time,” and turned his focus to biogerontology. By investigating the biological processes involved in aging, he writes, researchers in this field are getting closer to being able to halt or even reverse such processes. The result of this ambitious undertaking would be to pry apart, for the first time in human history, two things that have always gone together: the length of time we’ve spent on this earth and the condition of our minds and bodies. As the author puts it: “Our chronological age would no longer be the defining number by which we live our lives.”The relationship between aging and the indignities that have invariably accompanied it — physical infirmity, expiring fertility, slackening acuity, greater vulnerability to disease — has traditionally been so tight that Steele works hard to show that the two need not travel together. In this effort he relies heavily on examples from the animal kingdom, such as the Galápagos tortoise, which dwells for the many decades of its life in an enviable state known as “negligible senescence.”
