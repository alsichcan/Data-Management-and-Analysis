Gabriela Garcia Remembers the Women Who Helped Make Her a Best Seller
MUJER POWER Gabriela Garcia dedicated her debut novel, “Of Women and Salt,” to Iraida Rosa López, her 101-year-old grandmother who emigrated to the United States from Cuba in 1968. In a photograph pinned at the top of Garcia’s Twitter feed, López is wearing jazzy sneakers and holding a Black Lives Matter sign; even without a neatly printed Spanish expletive, it would be clear that this is a woman with strong convictions.“I grew up in a matrilineal family,” said Garcia in a phone interview. “I had all sisters, my mother had all sisters, my grandmother had all sisters. I was raised by a single mother and I never felt a lack in that. My grandmother was an important figure for me growing up; she helped raise me my entire life, so I wanted to dedicate the book to her.”“Of Women and Salt” mines the lives of mothers and daughters across five generations and four countries, from 19th-century Cuba to present-day Miami and Mexico. Garcia worked on the book while earning her M.F.A. at Purdue University, where Roxane Gay was an early champion of her work. “I won’t romanticize the act of writing. It can be excruciatingly difficult,” Garcia said. The hardest part was coming up with the structure of the story, which is told from alternating perspectives: “When I first started I thought it would be a linked story collection. Then I brought in all these pieces that don’t really work as stand-alone stories, so it just started becoming this hard-to-define novel.”Readers have embraced the challenge. “Of Women and Salt” debuted last week at No. 13 on the hardcover fiction list, an occasion Garcia described as “beyond my wildest dreams.”
