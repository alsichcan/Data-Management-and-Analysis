He’s a Murderer, a Stalker, a Creep — and an Entertaining Narrator
Caroline Kepnes must be some kind of storytelling sorcerer. How else can Joe Goldberg — stalker, creep, multiple murderer, blamer of everyone else but himself, a “long overdue book, the one you never thought was coming” — be such an entertaining narrator? Even Tom Ripley, Patricia Highsmith’s famously amoral character (a clear inspiration for Kepnes), could be enjoyed at a third-person remove, unlike the in-your-face immediacy of Joe’s blinkered perspective.After wreaking harm and havoc in “You” and “Hidden Bodies,” Joe returns in YOU LOVE ME (Random House, 385 pp., $24.99), having relocated to Bainbridge Island. His latest obsession, Mary Kay, is his boss at the local library. The Joe Goldberg she gets to know is a projection of the self he wants to portray. The Joe readers have gotten to know falls headfirst into Instagram account tracking, not-so-subtle manipulation and, when it suits him, violence. (Listening to Mary Kay bite into a candy cane, he thinks: “Crunch. Like the rock hitting Melanda’s head in the woods.”)This high-wire narrative act continues to work because Kepnes is brilliant at depicting the cognitive dissonance of someone like Joe. His stalkerish behavior steps over the line again and again, but in a way that is all too familiar to any woman menaced or made uncomfortable by the so-called “good guy.” No doubt he’ll return in future installments, demonstrating the shattered barrier between id and superego.Nikki Griffin, who returns in S. A. Lelchuk’s second novel, ONE GOT AWAY (Flatiron, 294 pp., $27.99), might be the reverse-funhouse mirror version of Joe Goldberg. The bookstore she owns on the ground floor of a Bay Area building is acceptable cover for the investigation business she conducts in her upstairs office, focusing on the misbegotten deeds of bad men who prey on women. Stalking and punishing the most abusive of the bunch is a personal mission for Nikki.
