A Drug-Fueled New York City Bacchanal and the Lives It Changed
THE BLIZZARD PARTYBy Jack LivingsThe tony uptown doorman building of Manhattan is a fertile environment for a spiritually restless literary character to make his home. Holden Caulfield grew up in one. So did the children of the Great American Author patriarch in David Gilbert’s engaging 2013 novel “& Sons.”An architectural and cultural subset of such apartment houses is the gargantuan, prewar Upper West Side palace, at once a city-state of casual opulence and a provincial village stuffed with eccentrics. In Tom Barbash’s 2018 novel “The Dakota Winters,” set in the Dakota Apartments on Central Park West in the year leading up to John Lennon’s 1980 murder at the building’s entrance, the young narrator struggled to shape an independent identity in the shadow of his larger-than-life father, a troubled television talk show host.Five blocks north, Hazel Saltwater, the middle-aged narrator of Jack Livings’s kaleidoscopic debut novel, “The Blizzard Party,” occupies similar literary territory, looking back at the same early-Koch-era New York City, a place of violence, revelry and happenstance. Ensconced in her childhood apartment in the monumental Apelles co-op, a full-block palazzo unmistakably modeled on the Apthorp at 78th Street and Broadway, Hazel methodically recounts a catastrophic concatenation of events during a city-smothering blizzard in 1978.
