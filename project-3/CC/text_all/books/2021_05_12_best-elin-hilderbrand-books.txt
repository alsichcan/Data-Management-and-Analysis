The Essential Elin Hilderbrand
What’s the best way to discover Elin Hilderbrand? Look on the wicker shelf in your rented beach house. There you’ll find her shoulder to shoulder with Dean Koontz, Terry McMillan, Emily Giffin and other titans of summer whose well-thumbed volumes have not been left behind so much as bequeathed to the next wave of vacationers.Once you’ve located a chunky Hilderbrand novel, it won’t matter that the water view you were promised is visible only through binoculars from the roof. Say goodbye to Malibu, Miami or Mantaloking; you’re now en route to Nantucket, where most of Hilderbrand’s 27 books take place. (For the past 15 years, she has published at least one a year, sometimes two.) Personally, I’ve never set foot on the island, but thanks to these books, you could drop me at the ferry dock and I’d be able to find my way to Madaket Beach, Sankaty Head Light, Jewel Pond or any number of places where Hilderbrand’s characters dine, swim, cheat, marry and, yes, die.These books are escape hatches for serious readers, bridges between mothers and daughters, cat’s cradles connecting friends. They’re beach reads with undertow — a confluence of frivolity (picnics, convertibles, flings) and gravity (divorce, deception, loss). They unlock the doors of sumptuous mansions and weathered cottages, lay out buffets ranging from fried clam strips to bouillabaisse, and introduce characters of all ages, perspectives and incomes.
