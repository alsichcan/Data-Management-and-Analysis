He’s angry at his new stepmoms (both named Charlie). He’s angry at the world. It’s an anger that is real and hard.But there’s “at least one thing” Mickey likes: Bubble Gum King bubble gum. There’s a little prize in every pack.This time the prize is a coupon for a mysterious “Anti-Book.” The ad reads:DO YOU EVER WISH EVERYONE WOULD GO AWAY? ARE YOU ANTI-EVERYTHING?THE ANTI-BOOK IS THE ANSWER!The book arrives. And inside it’s blank, except for the words “To erase it, write it.”Mickey does exactly that. He writes a list of the people and things he’d like to erase from his life. Sister, mom, dad, school, tight underwear, loose underwear, things that don’t come with batteries: It’s a long list.
