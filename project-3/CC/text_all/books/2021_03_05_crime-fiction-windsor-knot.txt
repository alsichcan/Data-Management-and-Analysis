Queen Elizabeth II, Amateur Detective
I began reading THE WINDSOR KNOT (Morrow, 288 pp., $27.99) in a state of bafflement. Queen Elizabeth II solves mysteries? Is “Lady Caroline Cadwallader” a homage to the celebrated Guardian journalist? Why is Prince Philip behaving so gallantly? But when one character opines that “the problem with Windsor Castle is that it is a dream. Real people only ruin it,” I put aside confusion and surrendered to the sheer entertainment value of SJ Bennett’s first mystery for adults, set as the queen approaches an alternate-reality version of her 90th birthday in 2016.The life of a monarch is heavily regimented, and murders are, shall we say, inconvenient. The case of the Russian pianist found strangled at the castle proves vexing, since MI5 reaches a conclusion the queen takes umbrage with. So, as her assistant private secretary, Rozie Oshodi, discovers in astonishment, Elizabeth starts to sleuth it out herself — so long as it’s clear she’ll never get credit.Bennett infuses wit and an arch sensibility into her prose. When the queen is told, “The hyoid bone was broken. That’s a bone in the neck,” she briskly interrupts: “‘I know about hyoid bones.’ She’d read a lot of Dick Francis novels. Hyoids were breaking all the time. Never a good sign.”This is not mere froth, it is pure confection — and the first, I expect, of more royal detecting adventures.
