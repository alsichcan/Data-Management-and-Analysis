When You Roast Your Friends in a Book, and One’s Your Landlord
HIGHER GROUNDBy Anke StellingTranslated by Lucy JonesResi is a writer and mother of four in Berlin who has just received her eviction notice. Her friends live together nearby in a building they designed themselves, a cross between commune and architectural showpiece. Resi wrote a book mocking them and their pet project, and now they cannot forgive her. Unfortunately, one of them holds her lease. As she faces the prospect of moving to an unfashionable suburb, she writes a letter to her eldest daughter, Bea. She wants Bea to know that the German promise of equal opportunity is a lie. You can’t escape where you’re from.The setup of Anke Stelling’s new novel, “Higher Ground,” is also most of the story. Resi — whose name comes from parrhesia, Greek for unfettered speech — spends much of her time in a broom closet, typing angrily. She recalls her mother’s early disappointments in love, as well as her own. She writes accusatory letters and deletes them. It’s not that she was excluded from the building plan. Her friends asked her to join them and offered to cover the down payment. But she resents the offer, and begrudges them their steady jobs and docile children. Above all she seems to resent herself: for not getting a degree, for marrying another artist, for having four kids and no steady income.
