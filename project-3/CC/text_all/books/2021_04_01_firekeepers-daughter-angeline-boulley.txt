It Takes Gumption to Work on a Novel For 10 Years. Ask Angeline Boulley.
EARLY BIRD Wunderkind novelists are fun to hoot and holler about, but late bloomers deserve a solemn moment of silence. Let’s offer one up for Angeline Boulley, a 55-year-old mother of three, who toiled over "Firekeeper’s Daughter” for 10 years — during her son’s hockey practices and in work meetings; through seasons of celebration (including her kids’ high school and college graduations); and periods of tumult (a move from Sault Ste. Marie, Mich., to Washington, D.C., a divorce).Last week, Boulley’s novel about a biracial college student who witnesses a murder debuted at No. 1 on the young adult hardcover list. What did she do when she heard the news? She admitted, “I shrieked for a full five minutes.” That was her prerogative.Boulley, who is a member of the Sault Ste. Marie tribe of Chippewa Indians, said she was eager to create a character who claims her identity as an Ojibwe woman. She said, “I have a mantra: I’m writing about trauma, but I’m not writing a tragedy. I didn’t want to lose sight of the funny and loving and wonderful things about my community even though I was talking about meth and other unpleasant truths.”The idea for “Firekeeper’s Daughter” started percolating when Boulley was a senior in high school, but she didn’t start writing until she was 44: “The story started out as a whisper and then it got louder and louder.”
