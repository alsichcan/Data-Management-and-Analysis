New in Paperback: ‘Minor Feelings’ and ‘Bubblegum’
THE ILLNESS LESSON, by Clare Beams. (Anchor, 288 pp., $16.) It’s 1871 in small-town Massachusetts. Eight female students at odds with the male founder of a girls school fall mysteriously ill, but are told they are not ill. “Then there is that flock of ‘disastrous-bright’ red birds that shows up, inexplicably, one day, injecting an element of Hitchcockian surrealism” into this “sly,” “astoundingly original” debut novel that, according to our reviewer, Siobhan Jones, “belongs on the shelf with your Margaret Atwood and Octavia Butler collections.”THEN THE FISH SWALLOWED HIM, by Amir Ahmadi Arian. (HarperVia, 288 pp., $16.99.) A lonely bus driver named Yunus (after the prophet Jonah, who is swallowed by a big fish) becomes the scapegoat for violence at a union strike in this novel of entrapment and torture at Iran’s notorious Evin Prison.MINOR FEELINGS: An Asian American Reckoning, by Cathy Park Hong. (One World, 224 pp., $18.) A National Book Critics Circle Award finalist, this collection of essays, full of “candor and dark humor shot through with glittering self-awareness,” in the words of the Times critic Jennifer Szalai, explores feelings that are “ambient and chronic” — or, as its Korean-American poet-author puts it, built from the “sediments” of “everyday racial experience.”TOPICS OF CONVERSATION, by Miranda Popkey. (Vintage, 224 pp., $15.) This novel in 10 conversations highlights “inflection points” in the narrator’s life, from which she hopes to “excavate some sort of arc,” a “scaffolding” for her own “pulsing interior dialogue.” Our reviewer, Antonia Hitchens, declared Popkey good company. “I liked being inside her mind.”
