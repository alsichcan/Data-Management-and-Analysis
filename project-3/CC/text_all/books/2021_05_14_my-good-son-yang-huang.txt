What Makes a Good Chinese Father? In a New Novel, It’s Complicated.
MY GOOD SONBy Yang HuangEarly in Yang Huang’s new novel, “My Good Son,” we see a middle-aged tailor, Mr. Cai, working in his shop. “All his planning, cutting and sewing took final shape,” Huang writes. “In the end the garment itself made sense.” For Mr. Cai, it’s a rare moment of pride, a recognition that there is value, even contentment, in a hard day’s work. But the rest of the time, he sees his working-class life as a cautionary tale for his aimless 22-year-old son, Feng. Determined to save him from a life of tailoring, Mr. Cai makes it his mission to send Feng to a university in the United States. All Mr. Cai needs is an American willing to sponsor a student visa for Feng.Enter Jude, an American expat and Mr. Cai’s newest customer. Mr. Cai asks Jude to persuade his father, a Texas businessman, to become Feng’s sponsor. Jude agrees but wants a favor in return: Jude is gay, and believes that Feng, by posing as his “best friend” (which Mr. Cai suspects is code for “gay lover”), might help persuade Jude’s father to accept his sexuality (Jude has yet to come out to his family). It’s a convoluted scheme; Jude’s logic that a Chinese “best friend” might push his conservative father toward acceptance is difficult for Mr. Cai (and, admittedly, this reader) to track. Nonetheless, Mr. Cai tells his son to play along, convincing him that his only hope for success is to study abroad. “Don’t be a loser,” he tells Feng. “All my labors are wasted if you end up like me.”
