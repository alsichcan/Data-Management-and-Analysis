Here Is Fiction as an Escape Room, Packed With Mysteries
SUBDIVISIONBy J. Robert LennonLET ME THINKBy J. Robert LennonThe prize at the end of the so-called puzzle-box narrative — that amnesiac riddle, that prism held up to reality — is a return to reality itself. If the protagonist can best the maze, we all end up on solid ground, together. The television show “WandaVision” comes to mind, and recent books including Marie-Helene Bertino’s “Parakeet” and Marie NDiaye’s “That Time of Year,” stories where real life hides in a matrix of the narrator’s grief.But it’s also an old fun house, fiction as escape room. The mysteries are at once simple and profound: Who am I? Who are you? How did we get here? What happened to us? There is a secret to uncover, and the secret is perhaps best described as plot. If we can only focus for long enough, the answer will arrive and we will be released.J. Robert Lennon’s ninth novel, “Subdivision,” is a dazzling enigma packed with mysteries in miniature. There are houses built in probability wells, adventures in quantum tunneling and quizzes on whether or not characters have behaved wisely. There’s even an actual jigsaw puzzle that, once completed, may lead us out of this intricately planned trap — only the pieces are blurry, constantly shifting, and the box with the reference image is lost.
