How Do You Illustrate Resilience? These Graphic Novels Show the Way.
A HOUSE WITHOUT WINDOWS (Humanoids, 166 pp., $19.99) pulls off something difficult with a quiet beauty. It mixes photography and comics from page to page, marshaling the strengths of each in the service of a devastating topic: the precarious lives of children in the Central African Republic, the former French colony that is one of the poorest countries in the world.A collaboration between the English journalist Marc Ellison, who wrote and took photographs for the book, and the Central African artist Didier Kassaï, whose ink-and-watercolor comics animate its narrative, “A House Without Windows” unfolds in three chapters, each focusing on the life experiences of individual children while also reporting on systematic conditions brought about by war and sectarian violence. (It is translated from the French by Nanette McGuinness.) Broadly, the first part locates us in the streets of the capital, Bangui; the second, in diamond mines; and the third, in a hospital run by Doctors Without Borders (“the country’s de facto health service,” the book notes). A profound meditation on the possibility of resilience and the future for young people in the Central African Republic, this hybrid reportage succeeds in no small part because of Kassaï’s elegantly modest drawings.In a book whose content is far from understated — it chronicles, in part, the brutality kids face — Kassaï movingly deploys understated effects. This can happen through simple beats of silence that ask a reader to take in the severity or scope of a situation (say, a child accused of witchcraft). This can also happen through subtle visual details.
