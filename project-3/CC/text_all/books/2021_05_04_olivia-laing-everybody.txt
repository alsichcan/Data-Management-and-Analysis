Olivia Laing’s Latest Subject Is Bodily Integrity
EVERYBODY A Book About Freedom By Olivia LaingOlivia Laing is known for meandering, critical yet personal nonfiction, drawing upon the lives and work of others to explore a central question, from loneliness to addiction. In “Everybody” — her sixth book, following her 2018 novel, “Crudo,” and last year’s essay collection, “Funny Weather” — Laing’s concern is the human body and its relationship to freedom. Disturbed by the refugee crisis (those “desperate bodies … penned in camps from which they would potentially never escape”) and inspired by the Black Lives Matter movement, in 2016 Laing came to the curiously naïve realization that the “painful, inching progress” of 20th-century liberation movements had been “rapidly reversed.” Eager to understand the forces that “limit bodily freedom,” Laing turned to Wilhelm Reich, a 20th-century Austrian psychoanalyst most famous for his interest in orgasms. “What Reich wanted to understand was the body itself,” Laing explains. “Why it’s so difficult to inhabit, why you might want to escape or subdue it, why it remains a naked source of power, even now.” Laing shares this admirable desire and goes to great lengths to fulfill it. The result, however, is a well-intentioned yet ultimately exasperating book that would have been well served by the very thing it resists: clarifying constraints.
