‘W-3,’ a Memoir That Recalls Suffering Without Sentimentality or Sensationalism
Quickly: What one trait defines the great heroines of American literature?Don’t invoke their grim ends. Can one quality in life unite Daisy Miller, Edna Pontellier, Lily Bart, Sister Carrie?Bette Howland thought so. The classic American heroine, Howland once wrote, breaks the rules and infuriates society out of a mixture of innocence and defiance; she’s often only vaguely aware of the conventions she so scandalously flouts. Howland concerns herself with the characters above, but how neatly her theory applies to others as well, to Hester Prynne and Sula Peace. How neatly it applies to herself — as daring and thwarted an American heroine as any.Howland’s career was short, spectacular, perplexing. She was a 37-year-old single mother of two when she published her first book, “W-3,” in 1974, a memoir of a suicide attempt and time spent in a psychiatric hospital. In the span of a decade, she wrote two celebrated books of short fiction and was awarded a MacArthur “genius” grant, which was followed by prolonged silence. She never published a book again. Long before her death in 2017, she’d slipped into obscurity.She appears now to be part of a wave of rediscovered female writers enjoying posthumous revivals. But her case is more complicated than that and marked by mystery. This is not a story of mere neglect but of a writer’s collusion with invisibility, with a lifelong ambivalence toward selfhood and its burdens.
