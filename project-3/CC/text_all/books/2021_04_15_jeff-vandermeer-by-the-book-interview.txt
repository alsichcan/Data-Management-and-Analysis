How Jeff VanderMeer Prevents Writer’s Block
“I get superstitious,” says the author, whose latest novel is “Hummingbird Salamander”: “I once had a book sent to me that was disrupting my ability to write a novel because of a superficial similarity between the two. I took that book and dug a hole and buried it deep in the backyard.”What books are on your night stand?I chose the night stand for its stalwart qualities and it is currently holding up well under the eclectic weight of an advance copy of John Paul Brammer’s “¡Hola Papi!,” B. R. Yeager’s “Negative Space,” Bernard Rudofsky’s “The Prodigious Builders,” Eley Williams’s “The Liar’s Dictionary,” Rita Indiana’s “Tentacle,” Stephen Graham Jones’s “The Only Good Indians,” Julienne Ford’s “Paradigms and Fairy Tales,” Angelo Maria Ripellino’s “Magic Prague,” Vigdis Hjorth’s “Will and Testament” and Sayak Valencia’s “Gore Capitalism.” I’ll leave it to readers to guess which are for research and which for pleasure.What’s the last great book you read?The novel I can’t get out of my head is Audrey Schulman’s mid-Collapse “Theory of Bastards,” with its nuanced confluence of the personal and the epic, the human and the nonhuman. The poetry book I can’t shake is Vanessa Angélica Villarreal’s “Beast Meridian,” which takes so many chances, is so, so brilliant, and the lines just burn into you.Are there any classic novels that you only recently read for the first time?Gogol’s “Dead Souls” had escaped me — or, rather, I’d started and stopped reading several times, perhaps unable to reconcile the style with that of beloved short stories, like “The Nose.” But I sneaked unnoticed into the Everyman Library edition recently and, burrowing deep, loved the rich complexity, the wise and barbed exploration of corruption and the absurd irrationality of the human condition.
