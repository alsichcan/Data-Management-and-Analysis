William Boyd’s Madcap Burlesque Revisits the Summer of 1968
TRIOBy William BoydIt would be hard to think of a living novelist whose books encompass more history, more settings, more professions, more varieties of individual fate, than William Boyd — at least with anything like his assurance. Spies, photographers, climatologists, psychiatrists — in colonial Africa, prewar Vienna, the American South: You name it, and there is almost certainly something in Boyd’s prolific oeuvre that has it covered. For readers who go to fiction for the pleasures of panoramic sweep, elaborate plotting and the company of a humane, genial intelligence, he has become one of the preferred masters.His new book, “Trio,” delivers much of the same set of literary goods, with perhaps a lighter touch than usual. It’s another period piece: summer of 1968, set mostly in Brighton (a byword for a certain English loucheness), where its three principal characters are all in one way or another connected to the bumpy production of a film bearing the ominously winsome title “Emily Bracegirdle’s Extremely Useful Ladder to the Moon.”
