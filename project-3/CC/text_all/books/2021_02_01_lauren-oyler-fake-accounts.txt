‘Fake Accounts’ Examines the Alluring Trap of Our Online Personas
FAKE ACCOUNTSBy Lauren OylerLauren Oyler’s “Fake Accounts” is an invigorating work, deadly precise in its skewering of people, places and things. It’s a novel about social media and its insidious creep into our lives, the way it has reconfigured our behavior, relationships and — perhaps most critically, for the ambitions of this book — the way we think about and relate to ourselves.Most readers will recognize the exhilarations and degradations of online activity that Oyler describes. These daily sins range from mere procrastination and online stalking to full-fledged impersonation and political derangement. Various platforms — Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Tinder and its ilk — are present not as texture, but as major motors of character and plot.But “Fake Accounts” is also the work of a critic who has made a career of studying a much older piece of technology: the book, and in particular, the novel. Her debut is packed with references to contemporary writers, from Ben Lerner to Jenny Offill. My experience of “Fake Accounts” was not a little surreal, because a novel I wrote is the subject of one of these references (a neutral one).Oyler’s narrative opens at a precise historical moment: the interregnum between the 2016 election and the inauguration of Donald Trump. The nameless narrator discovers that her boyfriend, Felix, has a secret Instagram account, where he posts conspiracy theories and has cultivated something of a following. She resolves to break up with him, but before she does he dies in a bicycle accident in upstate New York. When his mother sends her a little money with no explanation, she decides to move to Berlin, the city where she and Felix met.
