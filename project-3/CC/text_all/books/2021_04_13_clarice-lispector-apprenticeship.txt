Clarice Lispector’s Lessons in Being Human
AN APPRENTICESHIPOr The Book of PleasuresBy Clarice LispectorTranslated by Stefan ToblerThe first word of Clarice Lispector’s newly translated 1969 novel, “An Apprenticeship, or The Book of Pleasures,” is not a word at all, but a mark: a comma. The story hurtles into view, like a glistening car coming around a curve, already at full speed. An invisible, eternal sentence streams from both ends of the work, more meaning that precedes and follows what we are reading. The entire book is only a fragment. (This is less abstract than it sounds: Aren’t we all born into the middle of someone else’s life?) Lispector is legendary in her adopted country, Brazil, for her genius and her glamour, and every translation of her writing is belated and urgent. We’re playing catch-up. Don’t hesitate.As always, Lispector’s plot bows to her form. This shard of language — reflective, serrated — is about a woman finding endlessness in the early morning, a warm body, the empty sea. She realizes that “whatever she was, was only a small part of herself.” On the surface, “An Apprenticeship,” elegantly translated here by Stefan Tobler, is an acute romance, between Lóri, a suicidal elementary schoolteacher, and her withholding, esoteric crush, a philosophy professor named Ulisses. But it is also a spiritual treatise, a didactic dialogue between not-yet lovers. With curiosity and kink, the couple embraces the power play of teacher-student, guru-acolyte relationships, but without solidifying who is who. He refuses to sleep with her until she is “ready,” and she undertakes this project with the devotion of a mystic — loving as a search for enlightenment. If you’re wondering, “Ready for what?” then you’re already on your way.
