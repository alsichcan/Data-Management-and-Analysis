Growing Up With a Revolution, and a Mystic Grandmother
THE BONE FIREBy Gyorgy DragomanTranslated by Ottilie Mulzet“Maglya,” the original Hungarian title of Gyorgy Dragoman’s novel “The Bone Fire,” means not quite a bonfire but a pyre, a place where one might be burned alive. For the book’s English translation, our word “bonfire” has been broken back down to its etymological roots: the literal fires of bones (and heretics and sinful objects), familiar to speakers of Middle English. That a word we now perceive as benign would have such macabre origins is a reminder that we don’t live terribly far removed from superstition and atavism, either historically or psychologically.“The Bone Fire” is Dragoman’s fourth work of fiction and his second to be translated into English, after “The White King” (2005). It achieves, like its English title, a disconcerting juxtaposition of the mundane and the primeval. On one level, it’s a real-world coming-of-age story, in which a teenager navigates both post-Communist aftershocks and the more personal issues of menstruation, crushes, friendships and bathing suits — and on another, it’s a tale of magic, ghosts and ancient memory.Thirteen-year-old Emma, whose dissident parents have died in a car accident, has spent six months at an orphanage when an old, recently widowed woman shows up to claim her, insisting she’s the grandmother Emma never knew. The woman convinces the headmistress easily enough, and perhaps hypnotizes Emma, who moves with her to a new city. That a librarian at her new school sees a family resemblance, having known Emma’s mother, is about the only evidence we get of blood ties, but readers seeking definitive resolution will soon realize it’s a moot point. Both widow and orphan have been alone and now have each other, and the folk wisdom and witchcraft the grandmother passes down (love spells, golems, how to lie) become a stronger lineage than genetics.
