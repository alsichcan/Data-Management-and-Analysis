At the Inauguration, Amanda Gorman Wove History and the Future Into a Stirring Melody
The sun came out intermittently at President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s inauguration in Washington on Wednesday, but Amanda Gorman was her own source of illumination. With her canary-yellow Prada coat, her regal red headband, her thrice-scrubbed innocence and her exacting delivery, she was a one-person reminder that if winter is here, then spring cannot be far behind.The 22-year-old Gorman read her poem “The Hill We Climb” after performances by Lady Gaga, Jennifer Lopez and Garth Brooks — the great, the good and the well-intentioned. More notably, she appeared in the wake of poets who’ve read at previous presidential transitions, among them Robert Frost, Maya Angelou, Miller Williams, Elizabeth Alexander and Richard Blanco.It hardly matters that “The Hill We Climb” is not an eternal work of art: neither were the poems by Gorman’s predecessors. In cadences that fell somewhere between those of Lauryn Hill and Angelou herself, Gorman rose to meet a moment. She made the firm of Frost, Angelou, Williams, Alexander and Blanco seem mildly pretentious by comparison.Her poem blended the political and the personal. She imagined, she wrote, a country and a timeAfter four years during which language was debased — when it meant anything at all — Gorman offered a fortifying tablespoon of American plain-spokenness. She offered lucidity and euphony. Her hand motions were expressive, as if she were conducting an orchestra of one.
