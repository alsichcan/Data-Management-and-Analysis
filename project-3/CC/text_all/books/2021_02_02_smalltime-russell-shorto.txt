Russell Shorto’s Grandpa Was a ‘Smalltime’ Mobster
SMALLTIME A Story of My Family and the MobBy Russell ShortoIn the hierarchy of literary respect, fiction is king, followed by historical narrative and, dead last, the lowly memoir. To those who have never practiced it, or to those who practice it badly, memoir writing is simply a regurgitation of life events. But a well-crafted memoir involves archival research, hours of taped interviews and a narrative structure that leaves more on the cutting-room floor than on the page.Reporting on your own life or on the lives of people who share your DNA can be much more challenging than reporting on strangers. For starters, some friends and family will hate you for it. But the main difference is the emotional investment — and emotional payoff — which can push the memoir to the top of the literary heap.In his new book, “Smalltime,” after much throat clearing and hedging about not being a memoirist, Russell Shorto — a master of historical narrative — digs up the facts on his family. Until now, Shorto has written books mostly about people he’s never met, trying to get inside the heads of Peter Stuyvesant in “The Island at the Center of the World”; Baruch Spinoza in “Amsterdam”; and George Washington in his last book, “Revolution Song.” But the most fascinating characters in those books — for Shorto and for the reader — are always the ones that history has forgotten.An Italian-American whose family name was changed long ago from Sciotto, Shorto comes from a small-time criminal clan in Johnstown, Pa., people you have never heard of before. History has not forgotten them. It never knew them to begin with.
