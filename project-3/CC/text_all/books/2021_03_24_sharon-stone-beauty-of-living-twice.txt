Sharon Stone Is Telling Her Side of the Story
During an extended hospitalization in 2001, when Sharon Stone was being treated for a stroke and a subarachnoid hemorrhage that had bled into her brain, head and spine, she writes that she was visited by her grandmother Lela, who had been dead for 30 years.“This is where it gets weird,” Stone writes in a new memoir, “The Beauty of Living Twice,” which Knopf will publish on Tuesday. Lela came to convey a warning: “Whatever you do, don’t move your neck.”It is one of several scenes from her life that Stone, the 63-year-old star of films like “Basic Instinct,” “Casino” and “The Quick and the Dead,” relates with candor and sardonic humor. Despite her long career in Hollywood playing femme fatales and women of mystery — even in recent television series like “Mosaic” and “Ratched” — her memoir is a more episodic account of her life and upbringing, particularly her youth in modest Meadville, Pa., and the indelible but troubled family that raised her there.
