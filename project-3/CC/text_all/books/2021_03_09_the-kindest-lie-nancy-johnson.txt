Meet Three New Voices on the Fiction Front
THE KINDEST LIEBy Nancy Johnson336 pp. Morrow. $27.99.It’s November 2008 in Chicago. Obama is about to win the presidency, and the Bronzeville resident Ruth Tuttle’s sexy, stylish, marketing executive husband, Xavier, is eager for them to have a baby. Or 2.5 of them. Ruth is also well employed, if not exactly excitingly, as a chemical engineer tinkering with detergent formulas. They are young, successful and Black.But while Xavier was born “bougie,” Ruth is from blue-collar Ganton, Ind., home to a defunct auto parts plant and her deepest secret. At 17, she had a baby, gave him up for adoption and left in her old Pinto, “still heavy with her burden,” for a scholarship to Yale. Eleven years later, she’s increasingly tormented by dreams of her son, hungry, helpless and stuck in the dead end that is Ganton.Ruth can’t go forward until she goes back, so she heads home for Christmas, determined to find her son, only to be stonewalled by the grandmother who raised her. She’ll end up spending the entire holiday season piecing together the puzzle of his, and her own, identity.
