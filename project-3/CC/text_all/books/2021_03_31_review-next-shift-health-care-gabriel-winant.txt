How Health Care Became the Big Industry in Steel City
Bad times for American labor have also meant boom times for a certain strain of American nostalgia. According to a well-worn narrative, the postwar era was an idyll of heavy industry and stable union jobs; a family with 2.5 children could get by with just one breadwinner — the archetypical working-class man, who toiled in a sooty industrial plant before coming home to a house that was impeccably maintained by his doting wife.Decades after the collapse of its steel industry, Pittsburgh exemplifies how the trace memory of an old identity can live on in a football team (the Steelers), a nickname (Steel City) and even a local beer (Iron City), while the industry that actually flourishes there now — health care — garners no such reverence or recognition. The fastest growth in the sector isn’t for anesthetists or X-ray technicians but for poorly paid caregiving jobs; most of these care workers are women, and many of them are Black.During the pandemic, these workers have been called “essential” — but as the historian Gabriel Winant explains in “The Next Shift,” remuneration and job protections haven’t kept up. “Care workers are at once everywhere and nowhere,” Winant writes. “They are responsible for everyone, but no one is responsible for them.”The replacement of blue-collar work by pink-collar work has been much discussed, but what makes this book stand out is Winant’s argument that two seemingly distinct phenomena are in fact inextricably connected: “It was not a coincidence that care labor grew as industrial employment declined.” In the 1970s, deindustrialization pushed an ailing and aging population into unemployment, toward the welfare state — always tentative, in the American case — for their survival. Unlike other social institutions, which buckled under political pressure and austerity cuts, the American health care system flourished, having grown already in response to the rise of collectively bargained health insurance during the flush postwar years.
