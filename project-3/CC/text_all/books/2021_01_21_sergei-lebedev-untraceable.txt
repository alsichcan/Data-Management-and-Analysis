Raised on Le Carré, He Wrote a Thriller Dipped in Poison
Growing up in Moscow, Sergei Lebedev honed his English, reluctantly at first and then greedily, by reading his way through his family’s library of detective fiction.His parents, geologists who often used English in their work, particularly encouraged him to read the work of the spy novelist John le Carré. Lebedev grew to appreciate le Carré, the author of such books as “Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy” and “The Russia House,” for, he said, “defining what the Cold War looked like for ordinary readers.”Lebedev, now 39, decided to send le Carré a copy of his latest novel, “Untraceable,” after it was translated into English. But according to Lebedev, the writer died before he had a chance to read it.“I think he would have liked it,” Lebedev said during a video interview from his home in Berlin earlier this month. “Untraceable,” his first spy thriller after four novels that were more autobiographical in nature, shares some of le Carré’s fascination with secret worlds and the nature of evil.
