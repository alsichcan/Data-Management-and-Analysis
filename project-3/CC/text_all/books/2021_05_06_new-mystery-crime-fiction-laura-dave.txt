Disappearing Spouses and Dead Boyfriends
A spouse’s disappearance, and the ensuing discovery of a secret self hidden beneath the surface, ranks high on the list of well-worn plot devices. So how does Laura Dave make this conceit feel fresh in THE LAST THING HE TOLD ME (Simon & Schuster, 306 pp., $27)? I suspect it has something to do with her skill at character-driven fiction, remembering that people, and relationships, must drive the narrative.Hannah Hall has “raised losing things to an art form,” a tendency that didn’t stop when she married Owen Michaels. But she must rise above distraction and forgetfulness to figure out why Owen has left — and the meaning of his final words, relayed by his teenage daughter, Bailey, whose relationship with Hannah is prickly at best and uncommunicative at worst.Dave’s neat trick is to unveil revelations at a brisk clip that does not overwhelm character development. The novel’s richness comes from the way Hannah and Bailey realize they need each other in the face of staggering loss; the mutual trust that grows between them is genuinely moving. As both daughter and stepmother come to realize, “That’s how you fill in the blanks — with stories and memories from the people who love you.”
