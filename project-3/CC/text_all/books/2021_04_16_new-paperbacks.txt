New in Paperback: ‘Until the End of Time’ and ‘Warhol’
SQUARE HAUNTING: Five Writers in London Between the Wars, by Francesca Wade. (Crown, 432 pp., $18.) Bloomsbury’s Mecklenburgh Square was home to five pioneering feminists across 25 years: the poet H.D., the novelist Dorothy Sayers, the medievalist Eileen Power, the classicist Jane Ellen Harrison and, famously, Virginia Woolf. Our reviewer, Blanche Wiesen Cook, called Wade’s portrait of the group “enchanting.”UNTIL THE END OF TIME: Mind, Matter, and Our Search for Meaning in an Evolving Universe, by Brian Greene. (Vintage, 448 pp., $17.95.) “Often heartbreaking,” funny and “stuffed with too many profundities” to quote is the way our reviewer, Dennis Overbye, described this “meditation on how we go on doing what we do, why and how it will end badly, and why it matters anyway.”BRAISED PORK, by An Yu. (Grove, 240 pp., $16.) In this magical realist debut novel set in contemporary Beijing, the mysterious bathtub death of a young painter’s husband, who left behind a sketch of a half-man, half-fish, propels her on a journey into her past that leads to her estranged father, with whom she shares a meal of the book’s titular dish. Our reviewer, Karen Cheung, noted Yu’s “crisp” prose and “startling imagery.”WARHOL, by Blake Gopnik. (Ecco, 976 pp., $25.) Gopnik interviewed more than 260 people and consulted some 100,000 documents for this biography, our reviewer, Luc Sante, reported. But while Gopnik “excels at disentangling the strands” of the constantly changing Warhol narrative and “correcting common lore,” Sante concluded, we get only an “occasional fugitive glimpse of Warhol’s soul.”
