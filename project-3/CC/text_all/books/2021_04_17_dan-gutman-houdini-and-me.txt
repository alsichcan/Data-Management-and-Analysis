When Harry Met Harry
HOUDINI AND MEBy Dan GutmanThe best magicians are a little like the best priests, or novelists. They may be skeptical about the trade they ply — nothing tests your faith quite like knowing how the tricks are done — but they’re never cynical. At some level, some piece of them still wants to believe in the mystery.Harry Mancini is a fifth-grade boy who lives with his widowed mother in uptown Manhattan. Specifically, he lives at 278 West 113th Street — in the very house where a century ago Harry Houdini spent the last two decades of his life. That fact, plus the similarity of their names, means that one Harry is obsessed with the other. And maybe vice versa, since magic is at the heart of Dan Gutman’s new middle grade novel, “Houdini and Me.”In the opening chapters, young Harry suffers a bad bump on the head while he and a friend are playing near the train tracks. When he comes to in the hospital, he spies a mysterious cellphone among the boxes of candy by his bed, and before long he’s having a lively text exchange with what appears to be Houdini’s ghost.Gutman (“The Homework Machine,” “The Genius Files”) is an old hand at this sort of thing. He used a similar time-travel approach in his Baseball Card Adventure series for biographical stories like “Babe & Me,” “Jackie & Me” and “Honus & Me.”
