Kicking Homer to the Curb: The American Scholar Who Upended the Classics
HEARING HOMER’S SONGThe Brief Life and Big Idea of Milman ParryBy Robert KanigelBy the time he died in a Los Angeles hotel in 1935 — at 33, fatally wounded by his own gun — the classicist Milman Parry had accomplished more than academics twice his age ever dream of. The son of an Oakland, Calif., druggist, Parry, who had earned a position at Harvard at age 27, would in the intervening years completely revolutionize the study of Homer’s “Iliad” and “Odyssey,” showing that the epics had not been written, as had long been thought, but were oral — composed in the act of performance. Nearly a century after his death, he is still known as “the Darwin of Homeric Studies.” His work has had wide-ranging ramifications, ushering in an emphasis on orality that has become increasingly central to modern literary culture — from professional storytellers and TED talks to podcasts and audiobooks. In “Hearing Homer’s Song,” the biographer Robert Kanigel offers the first full-scale account of Parry’s short life, mysterious demise and long-lived influence.
