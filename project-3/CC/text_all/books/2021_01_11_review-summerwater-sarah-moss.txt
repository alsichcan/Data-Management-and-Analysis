‘Summerwater’ Makes an Intimate Study of Social Class Out of a Long, Rainy Day
Against the wisdom of the ages, you can tell a book by its cover. You can usually tell one by its title, too.“Summerwater” is Sarah Moss’s new novel. Her title is taken from the “The Ballad of Semmerwater,” a poem by the Englishman William Watson (1858-1935). It suggests density and perhaps difficulty, in the manner of the word “riverrun,” which appears in the first sentence of “Finnegans Wake.” As titles go, it’s mildly pretentious.Yet Moss, except in flashes, is anything but a pretentious writer. She writes beautifully about English middle-class life, about souls in tumult, about people whose lives have not turned out the way they’d hoped.She catches the details of ordinary existence in a manner that’s reminiscent of the director Mike Leigh: the peeling roof tiles, the cheap plastic teakettles, the beans on toast. She never condescends, and her fluid prose is suggestive of larger and darker human themes.
