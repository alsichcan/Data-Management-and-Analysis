Two Memoirists Explore Abuse and Survival
ASSUME NOTHINGA Story of Intimate ViolenceBy Tanya SelvaratnamCONSENTA MemoirBy Vanessa SpringoraEven in our chatty, confessional culture, certain subjects are too unwieldly, too difficult, too painful to easily and effectively put into words. These are stories so long kept secret, denied, pushed into recesses, played down and bluffed through, that telling them straightforwardly is nearly impossible. Yet two recent books rather brilliantly accomplish just that.In “Assume Nothing: A Story of Intimate Violence,” Tanya Selvaratnam, a successful film producer and activist, writes about how she fell into an abusive relationship with the former attorney general of New York, Eric Schneiderman. He was a rising political star, high-profile Trump enemy and ally of women’s causes. She writes candidly about how she was drawn to his influence: “I heard the applause when Eric spoke, and I got swept up in it.”In crisp, unadorned prose, Selvaratnam offers up an accumulation of small details: the slowly building feeling, amid moments of tenderness and excitement, that something is wrong. She can’t eat certain things, has to wear her hair a certain way, can’t sleep in her own apartment, can’t talk on the phone with friends. In the bedroom, he chokes and hits her, calls her his “brown slave.” He slowly chips away at her; she must occupy a smaller and smaller space, even as her life is outwardly glamorous, functional.In the course of Selvaratnam’s careful, detailed narrative, we see how a story that looks extraordinary isn’t extraordinary. We see how millions of other less sensational, lower profile stories of abuse are contained within this one. How step by step, a strong woman is seduced by the confounding combination of male woundedness and power.
