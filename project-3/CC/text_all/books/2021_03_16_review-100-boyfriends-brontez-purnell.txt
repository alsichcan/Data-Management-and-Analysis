‘100 Boyfriends’ Tells Lewd and Lonely Stories of Desire and Heartbreak
For all the chaos of which he seems singularly capable, the ex-boyfriend remains a strangely underrepresented character in literature. We might have Gatsby, Baldwin’s Giovanni, any number of Emma Bovary’s paramours (if they qualify), but I can rattle off twice as many charismatic fictional cats, and almost as many pigs.But along comes Brontez Purnell with his new — novel, is it? Linked stories? Let’s settle on hurricane. This hurricane of delirious, lonely, lewd tales is a taxonomy and grand unified theory of the boyfriend, in every tense.Purnell’s stories pinwheel, with a rotating cast of narrators and shifting points of view. Paragraphs run quick and cool, like stacked ice cubes; the chapters are often devoted to one particular man — the meth head, the white boy with the dreadlocks, the Satanist offering Magic: The Gathering tutorials and pentagram-embossed condoms.It is known that mothers retain fetal cells of the children they have carried. In the world of Purnell, there is no intimacy that doesn’t leave its traces, its residue. “There have to be 100 ghosts in this room already and that’s just the baggage I’m carrying,” one character thinks. “There are too many men here” — and not, he laments, in a sexy way.
