Michael Lewis Chronicles the Story of Covid’s Cassandras
THE PREMONITIONA Pandemic StoryBy Michael LewisWe are almost halfway through “The Premonition,” Michael Lewis’s maddening account of America’s bungled response to the Covid pandemic, when an unsung health official in California, making her birthday resolutions, scrawls a foreboding note to herself: “It Has Started.” The official is Charity Dean, who sounds a little like the half-crazed scientist in a science fiction movie, suddenly realizing that the aliens are about to land.It is December 2019. Dean, who will spend the next months trying and failing to prevent a national catastrophe, does not yet know what, exactly, has started. But we do. The coronavirus will spread from China to California, where Dean was then the state’s No. 2 public health official, and soon enough to everywhere else. As I write, Covid has killed more than three million people worldwide, including over half a million Americans, and is now burning ferociously anew through India.We do not yet know how the movie ends. But Lewis, whose book is among the first wave of narrative accounts of the pandemic, is more interested in how it began. Believed to be the rich country best prepared for a pandemic, we ended up with almost a fifth of the world’s Covid deaths. Popular blame has centered, not undeservedly, on former President Donald Trump, who ignored his advisers’ warnings, publicly downplayed Covid’s dangers in the hopes of preserving his re-election chances and left states to fend for themselves. But Lewis has a different thesis. As one character puts it, “Trump was a comorbidity.” The rot ran deep through the American system of public health, and in particular the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, once considered a crown jewel of American government.
