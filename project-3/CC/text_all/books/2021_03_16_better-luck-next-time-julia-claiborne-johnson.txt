Three Historical Novels Explore the Strength of Human Connection
It’s easy to see why Julia Claiborne Johnson filled BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME (Custom House, 288 pp., $28.99) with movie-star look-alikes. Doesn’t a romantic comedy set on a 1930s Nevada dude ranch teeming with about-to-be-divorced women owe a certain debt to the era’s big-screen classics? Then again, it’s hard to believe a cinematic version could be any more fun than the small-page antics of the aptly named Flying Leap’s two hired hands and the pair of wealthy “guests” who seem determined to make their required stint as legal state residents as memorable as possible.Ward, a cash-poor Yale dropout, has been hired because Margaret, who runs the place, thinks he looks like Cary Grant. Which makes him a good partner for Sam, a failed actor with a striking resemblance to Gary Cooper. Sam and Ward are there to work but also to keep the ladies’ spirits up — “to look at,” Margaret has decreed, “but not touch.” Yet Ward, who narrates this account of the summer of 1938 from 30 years on, finds himself attracted to a skittish socialite from San Francisco named Emily (think Myrna Loy) and locking horns over the rules with her roommate, thrice-married Nina, an aviator from St. Louis with a “cobra gaze” who, Ward remarks, could double for Grace Kelly “if she’d been stretched on a rack.”Ward and Sam have secrets. Emily has second thoughts. Nina has a husband she seems, inexplicably, still to be in love with. He turns up on a bicycle not long after the surprise appearance of Emily’s exceedingly hostile young daughter, Portia, whose preferred method of transport is a purloined pony. Add a supporting cast of spoiled rich women (“I have all my underclothes handmade by Spanish nuns. Also my husband just dropped dead”) to nearby Reno’s potent mix of hooch, heartbreak and high altitude and, as Ward admits, things can — and do — get “messy.”
