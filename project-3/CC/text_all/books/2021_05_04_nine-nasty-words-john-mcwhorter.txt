John McWhorter Takes a Serious Look at Profanity
NINE NASTY WORDSEnglish in the Gutter — Then, Now, and ForeverBy John McWhorterDrop an f-bomb into conversation, and its detonation lights up the right hemisphere of your brain. That right-brained roguishness, the linguist John McWhorter tells us, sets profanities apart from ordinary words, which are mediated by the comparatively sober left brain. Yet each of the explosive utterances that we now consider profane started life as a neutral left-brain word before hopping hemispheres. Over time, some once-offensive profanities like “hell” have even seemed to jump back, living out their twilight years as harmless words again. Can we map the movements of these restless bits of language? More broadly, what do they tell us about English, and about ourselves?In “Nine Nasty Words,” McWhorter describes the evolution of some of the most notorious profanities in English, applying the tools of linguistics to find “structure in what seems like chaos, mess or the trivial.” Thankfully, his aim is not to Big-Bang the chaos into perfect order, mop up the mess or roadblock the trivial. Instead, McWhorter deftly models a way for us to think deeply and systematically about language while celebrating its wildness, its slipperiness and its silliness. Those nasty words are really “nine nasty ways of being human.”McWhorter’s literary style does justice to the reality that language is a living thing; German’s Arsch, for instance, “hasn’t acquired any real estate in the pronoun neighborhood,” unlike its English counterpart ass. His anecdotes about his own run-ins with profanities encouraged me to reflect, with amusement and new interest, on how often those words have starred in my own life’s dramas and comedies. And throughout the book, McWhorter gives a master class in the comedic value of taking swearing seriously. Sometimes these moments are winningly puerile: “In future English, ass could spread to all adjectives” (bigass, richass), he speculates cheekily. On other occasions, the wordplay is less nakedly obvious, as when an ostensibly innocent paragraph on idealization and generalization in language gives way to a punning encomium to ass and to ass.The book’s winking style doesn’t stop McWhorter from taking his subject seriously, whether he is reconfiguring our understanding of pronouns, explaining “expletive infixation” or scrutinizing sexist and racist slurs. Slurs, McWhorter contends, are today’s true obscenities; to make sense of profanities, then, we must account for words like the N-word.
