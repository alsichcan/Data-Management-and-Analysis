A Family Reunites in Beirut, Where the Past Is Never Past
THE ARSONISTS’ CITYBy Hala AlyanThere is a home in Beirut — its small courtyard flanked by almond trees that shed a blanket of pink blooms each year — with a hole in its heart. Its owner, an old man, a grandfather, has died.His death is not the first in Hala Alyan’s new novel, “The Arsonists’ City.” The other man was young, and he was murdered decades ago, tangled in the complexities of Lebanon’s 15-year civil war. Rendered in the book’s breathless opening pages, his killing casts a line of anxiety deep into the saga that follows. The past is always lurking, waiting to breach the surface.Soon, you’ll know the younger man as intimately as the five members of the Nasr family, whose paths have been radically rerouted by both deaths: Mazna, Idris and their children Ava, Mimi and Naj, who are scattered around the world — the California desert, Brooklyn, Austin and Beirut. Their stories span decades, from the 1960s to the present day, and continents. The nucleus, though, is Beirut, and Alyan takes command of all the senses to portray the city before, during and after the war, its beaches packed with oiled-up bathers, its smoke-filled bars and steamy street corners. For those familiar with the setting, this novel will dredge up long-held memories. For those who’ve never known it, Alyan plants the riches of the city with stealthy precision, making the maddening conundrum of Beirut yours, whether you want it or not.
