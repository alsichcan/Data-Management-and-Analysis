How Do We Regain Trust in Institutions?
MISTRUSTWhy Losing Faith in Institutions Provides the Tools to Transform ThemBy Ethan ZuckermanIn his new book, “Mistrust,” Ethan Zuckerman takes us on a kaleidoscopic tour of everyone from Gandhi to Bitcoin enthusiasts, Brexit voters to Black Lives Matter activists — people and groups whom he calls “insurrectionists” because they are trying to overthrow or work around what has been a worldwide decline in social trust. Fighting this erosion from another direction are the “institutionalists,” those who seek to bolster trust and prevent any further crumbling.Zuckerman, the former director of the M.I.T. Center for Civic Media, writes with the tone of a sobered-up insurrectionist who’s come to see in Donald Trump, QAnon and antimask activists the dark side of a society in which all trust is lost and anything goes. Rather than liberation, Zuckerman correctly explains, this systematic distrust has proved to be a blessing for authoritarians around the world who have only further undermined traditional arbiters of truth (say, journalists) in order to open the way to their own propaganda. He offers the particularly absurdist example that in Vladimir Putin’s Russia, so all-encompassing is the leader’s control that many Russians see the mere fact that a dissident leader like Alexey Navalny hasn’t been murdered (yet) as evidence that he doesn’t represent a real opposition force.It’s clear Zuckerman hasn’t abandoned his insurrectionist sympathies for those trying to work outside a system they see as irreparably broken. He writes sympathetically about plainly loopy ideas like seasteading (the libertarian fantasy of building floating communities outside the reach of established states) and using the same blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrency to establish new virtual nation-states.But he seems to find most promising those activists with more conventionally progressive politics who embrace new tactics. He offers the fascinating story of the Association for the Empowerment of Workers and Peasants in India, along with the more familiar tales of Bryan Stevenson and the success of digital activists in reshaping coverage of law enforcement.
