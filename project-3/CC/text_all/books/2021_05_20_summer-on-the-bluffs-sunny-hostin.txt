When Your Name Is Sunny (Hostin), Your Beach Read Belongs on the Best-Seller List
SUNNY SIDE UP Wherever she goes, Sunny Hostin leaves stacks of books in her wake. In a phone interview, the co-host of “The View” described her voracious approach: “I read a couple chapters and then I pick up another book and I put that one down. I know I drive my husband a little bit crazy because wherever I’m perched, there are about five books on side tables.”When it came to escapist reading, Hostin noticed a dearth of books centered on women of color. “I don’t get it, if I’m being honest. Is it the trope that Black women aren’t going to pick up these books? Of course we do read, and of course we do read for fun,” Hostin said. “I think part of it is, some of the issues Black women face are pretty dark. There are a lot of books that reflect that experience, but we also want to read books of Black joy and love, sexy books with lust and secrets. We want that too.”So Hostin wrote the book she wanted to read — and she has two more in the works. Her debut novel, “Summer on the Bluffs,” which recently touched down at No. 11 on the hardcover fiction list, is the first in a trilogy of books set in historically Black beach communities. This first installment takes place in Oak Bluffs on Martha’s Vineyard; the next two will venture to Long Island’s Sag Harbor and Highland Beach in Maryland.Hostin said, “When I started writing, I knew that I didn’t want the book to be too light because that is not the experience of a woman of color in this country. But that doesn’t mean the context can’t be beautiful Oak Bluffs. It can be grounded in beauty and fun and elegance.”
