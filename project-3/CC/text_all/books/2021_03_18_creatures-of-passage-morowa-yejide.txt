A Cabdriver Who Also Ferries Souls and Ghosts? Just Another Day on the Job.
CREATURES OF PASSAGEBy Morowa YejidéMythic language will forever find a home in the Black American experience. Jail is the shadowed and forgotten realm to which mere chance can consign you. Jazz is Prometheus bringing fire to humans. The Great Migrations are Old Testament journeys, a rights-affirming Supreme Court case a New Testament parable. So myth is the tone of Morowa Yejidé’s second novel, “Creatures of Passage,” a modern-day fable about the fight for the soul of a boy who witnesses, and struggles to make sense of, an act of molestation at school.In “Creatures of Passage,” a cosmic lexicon describes mundane, earthbound life. In Yejidé’s hands, the Anacostia neighborhood of Washington, D.C., becomes the realm of Anacostia. The protagonist, Nephthys Kinwell, is, in one light, an alcoholic taxi driver, and, in another, a Stygian ferrywoman haunted by the violent death of her twin brother, Osiris. Rising fog announces her shifts and while she shuttles passengers to and from physical destinations, she is really shuttling them through emotional states, ferrying the soul as much as the body, all while the ghost of a murdered white woman passes the time in her trunk.
