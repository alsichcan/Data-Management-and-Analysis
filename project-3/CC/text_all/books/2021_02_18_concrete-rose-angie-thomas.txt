Angie Thomas’s ‘Concrete Rose’ Is a Love Song for Young Black Lives
CONCRETE ROSEBy Angie ThomasThe inheritance we carry from those who came before us is a knot of roots that can be complicated to unravel. It can take a lifetime of work to distinguish the threads that shape the people we grow to be.Angie Thomas’s latest young adult novel, “Concrete Rose,” takes on this challenge — sorting through a person’s becoming — with the author’s characteristic mastery. In her best-selling debut, “The Hate U Give,” all eyes were on Starr Carter, a 16-year-old girl who finds her voice after witnessing a police officer kill her best friend. But Starr didn’t develop into that young leader on her own; she was molded by those around her. One of those formative figures was her father, Maverick Carter. Now, Maverick is front and center in “Concrete Rose.”We meet Maverick on a pivotal day, years before the events of “The Hate U Give,” in the vibrant world of Garden Heights. At 17 years old, he’s just discovered he’s the father of a 3-month-old son. The sudden weight of his newfound responsibility forces him to make a choice: continue running with the King Lords, the gang he’s come into by way of his now-imprisoned father; or face the cost of leaving the gang and try to build a life for himself and his family outside of selling drugs.
