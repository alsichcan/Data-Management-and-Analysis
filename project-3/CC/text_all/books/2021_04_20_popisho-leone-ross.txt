A Magic-Filled Island Where Life’s Struggles Rage
POPISHOBy Leone RossIn the writers’ world, I’ve encountered the notion that ideas are like butterflies, landing softly on this shoulder or that brow and, if the writer is not quick enough, flitting off to find another, more receptive mind. The idea lends a sense of urgency to the writing process — quick, write that novel before someone else does! Or maybe it provides the hope that inspiration is plentiful and free and waiting to be plucked out of the air.I’m not convinced. Sure, on a basic level, every story has been told before and will be told again, but the novels I’ve found the most urgent and fascinating are so specific to their authors that they couldn’t have been written by anyone else.Case in point: Leone Ross’s fantastic new novel, “Popisho.” No one will persuade me that this bold, iridescent butterfly of a story could have landed on anyone’s shoulder but Ross’s.Ross was born in England of Jamaican-Scottish ancestry, and while she has built her career as a journalist, poet, editor, academic and novelist in the U.K., she was raised in Jamaica. But Popisho, the fictional island namesake of her third novel, is formed as much from fearless imagination as real-world Caribbean geography.
