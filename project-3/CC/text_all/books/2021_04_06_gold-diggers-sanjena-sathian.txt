From Digging for Gold to Drinking It, in a Novel of American Striving
GOLD DIGGERS By Sanjena SathianIn American high schools, it is not uncommon to see stressed-out teenagers pop an Adderall or Ritalin. Maybe they have A.D.H.D., or got the pill from a friend, a dealer, a parent. The goal often being to chase not a high, but the illusion of perfection. To live up to a parent’s expectations. To perform.In Sanjena Sathian’s debut novel, “Gold Diggers,” the teenage protagonist’s drug of choice is not quite F.D.A. approved: It is literal gold, treasures lifted from neighbors and vendors, smelted at home, mixed with sugar and lemons and imbibed as “lemonade.” The elixir instills the kind of maniacal focus — not just on a math test or school debate, but on an entire future — that is needed to “make it” as the child of immigrants in America.Neeraj, who goes by Neil, lives in the suburb of Hammond Creek, Ga., across the street from his classmate Anita Dayal. Anita’s mother, Anjali, is the one person in town who knows how to mix the golden drink, a legacy of her upbringing in Bombay. The year is roughly 2005, and Kanye’s “Gold Digger” is playing on repeat. In this world populated mostly by “desis” (South Asians and their American-born kids), the way to succeed looks, not coincidentally, a lot like the way to succeed in the white world: Go to Harvard.Some kids play the game dutifully. “My sister telegraphed her ambitions in the Duke poster on her wall,” Neil says. But for him, there is no poster. He fears a future limited by his “absorbed averageness” — which, for a brown person, means no future at all. That is, until his first sip of lemonade bonds him to generations of Indian ancestry.
