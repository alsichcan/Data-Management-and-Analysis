‘Plunder,’ a Gripping Reflection on What the Nazis Took and What It Would Mean to Take It Back
Menachem Kaiser’s “Plunder: A Memoir of Family Property and Nazi Treasure” tells a twisting and reverberant and consistently enthralling story. It’s a weird story that gets weirder.Kaiser, the descendant of Polish Jews, is a young writer who grew up in Toronto. “Plunder” is about what happens after he takes up his Holocaust-survivor grandfather’s battle to reclaim an apartment building in Sosnowiec, Poland, that the family owned before the war. The author has no great hope of success. His father and grandfather made inquiries over decades but got nowhere.Kaiser hires a Polish lawyer known as “The Killer.” She wears pink velour tracksuits under her black judicial garments. The Killer starts a process that has Kafkaesque hurdles. For example, Kaiser needs to prove that his ancestors, who were killed in the Holocaust and who would be 130 or 140 if still alive, are actually dead.At one point he has to hire a second lawyer to explain the actions of his first one.Court cases percolate in the background while Kaiser visits the property, where he finds good people with real lives. The building housed residents connected with a theater. They threw wonderful parties, and gathered for large social events. What’s he going to do, evict everyone?
