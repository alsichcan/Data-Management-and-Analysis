‘The Writing Hasn’t Changed’: Amanda Gorman on Life Post-Inauguration
A STAR IS BORN So far this year, Amanda Gorman has read her poetry aloud before two of the biggest audiences in the country: the presidential inauguration and the Super Bowl. Now her words are reaching readers in a more private format, too: A 32-page commemorative edition of her inaugural poem, “The Hill We Climb” — featuring a foreword by Oprah Winfrey — enters the fiction list this week at No. 1.“I was really excited when ‘The Hill We Climb’ became a book, because I knew it would be able to be integrated into people’s lives in new ways,” she said in a phone interview. She’s seen Instagram photos of people gifting it to one another, stuffing copies into Easter baskets: “That’s something you can’t do with a video, you can’t do with a performance, but once it’s physicalized, all of a sudden it can be interwoven into the ways people celebrate and cherish each other.”“When I’m performing a poem live, what I’m really thinking about is how it sounds,” Gorman said. When writing for the page, absent her voice, her cadences and intonations, she’s asking herself something quite different. “They might not be with me on the lawn of the Capitol, they might not be with me on the stage,” she said. “How does this feel as an experience for the reader on their own terms?”
