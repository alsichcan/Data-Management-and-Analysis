Kate Baer Is Speaking Truth. From Her Minivan.
Before the pandemic, when she could afford a babysitter, Kate Baer would write from a Panera Bread near her home in Hummelstown, Pa., where her favorite staffer, Annemarie, would save her the booth with the power outlet and didn’t mind if she brought her own food.“I’d order a tea and get out my peanut butter and jelly sandwich,” she said.Since the pandemic, the 35-year-old mother of four has been working from the Panera parking lot, sitting in her Honda minivan with her laptop propped against the steering wheel, attempting to catch a Wi-Fi signal. Baer wore triple layers, parked in the sun and occasionally blasted the heat to keep her fingers from getting numb.It was there that she wrote “What Kind of Woman,” a poetry collection that topped the New York Times best-seller list for paperback trade fiction when Harper Perennial released it late last year. It was her first piece of paid writing.It was also there that Baer wrote the first draft of her new book, a collection of “erasure poems” that repurpose the nasty messages she receives about her work, striking out words to create new poems.
