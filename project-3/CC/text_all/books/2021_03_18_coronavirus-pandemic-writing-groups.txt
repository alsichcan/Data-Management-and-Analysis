Still Stuck at Home? It Might Be Time to Work on That Novel.
It was another Covid-era Wednesday night, another Zoom call, but for the entire hour, nobody spoke.None of the attendees even looked at each other. All eight of their heads were tilted down, their pens and the corners of their notebooks occasionally bobbing into view of the laptop cameras.These writers were gathered, virtually, for their weekly accountability session, a variation on the traditional writing group that replaces discussions and feedback with focused quiet time. Some of these informal gatherings have flourished as people who once shied away from writing groups — because of the time commitment, commute or intimidation factor of a room full of aspiring authors — are finding that the pandemic has lowered the barriers to entry.“The idea of a writing community in New York is very scary,” said Hannah Pasternak, 25, an editor at Self magazine who started the group last March, around the time that many offices in New York City were closing because of the pandemic. “You feel like everybody is better than you, or everybody has a book deal and you don’t, or everybody is published in X magazine or Y magazine.”She was inspired by a fiction writing class she took at the 92nd Street Y in January 2020, which helped her realize that not all writing spaces needed to feel competitive. When the pandemic hit and she couldn’t take another class in person, she posted on Instagram that she would be writing for an hour that Wednesday night and invited anyone to join her.
