Virus Hastens Exit from Israel’s Ultra-Orthodox Community
JERUSALEM — When the pandemic swept through Israel, it upended Racheli Ohayon’s life in unexpected ways.The 21-year-old phone center worker had questioned her ultra-Orthodox Jewish upbringing before but always stifled such thoughts by drowning them in even stricter religious observance.Suddenly she was off work and under lockdown, her routines disrupted, holed up at home with seven younger siblings and plenty of time on her hands.“When I had a lot of time to think, the questions flooded up again,” she said. “Suddenly, the rabbis didn’t know what to do. They aren’t doctors.”
