Ex-Coach Sentenced to 10 Years for Raping Star Skater
A former national speedskating coach in South Korea was sentenced on Thursday to more than a decade in prison on charges of raping an Olympic athlete.The coach, Cho Jae-beom, was accused of rape in 2019 by Shim Suk-hee, a two-time Olympic gold medalist in short-track speedskating who said he had sexually assaulted her repeatedly starting when she was 17. A district court in the city of Suwon sentenced Mr. Cho to 10 years and six months in prison, along with 200 hours of treatment in a program for sex offenders.Ms. Shim, 23, is a well-regarded figure in a sport that is a source of national pride; short-track speedskating has produced more Olympic gold medals for South Korea than any other nation. But like other sports in the country, it has long been shadowed by allegations of corruption and abuse, with few victims willing to speak out.Prosecutors said the sexual assaults took place on 30 occasions from 2014 to 2017. Mr. Cho, who admitted to abusing Ms. Shim physically and verbally, denied the rape accusation, but the judge said on Thursday that Ms. Shimâ€™s testimony was credible, and that text messages the two had exchanged also pointed to an inappropriate coach-athlete relationship.
