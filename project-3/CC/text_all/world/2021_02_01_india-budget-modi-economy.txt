India’s Modest Budget Signals Modi’s Limited Options
NEW DELHI — The world’s biggest economies are trying to borrow and spend their way out of the pandemic, from the European Union’s $900 billion stimulus package to President Biden’s proposed $1.9 trillion rescue plan.Then there’s India.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government on Monday proposed a nearly half-a-trillion-dollar budget for the 12 months beginning on April 1 that shows New Delhi is taking a largely conservative tack. Infrastructure and health care spending are set to rise significantly, but Mr. Modi’s budget also calls for reducing debt.Over all, spending would rise less than 1 percent at a time when India is suffering from its worst recession in years while battling the coronavirus. India’s economy, once one of the world’s fastest growing, is estimated to have shrunk nearly 8 percent in the current fiscal year, which will end on March 31.“I don’t know why the government is so hung up on being fiscally conservative when the whole world is suggesting that this is the time, like no other, to be profligate,” said Mahesh Vyas, an economist and the chief executive of the Mumbai-based Center for Monitoring the Indian Economy.
