In Beleaguered Babylon, Doing Battle Against Time, Water and Modern Civilization
BABYLON, Iraq — Ammar al-Taee, an Iraqi archaeologist, picked up a clay panel fallen from one of the ancient walls of Babylon. Paw prints of a dog that wandered onto the drying clay more than 2,000 years ago obscure part of the cuneiform inscription — a reminder that these ruins were once a living city.“This is the heritage of Iraq, and we need to save it,” said Mr. al-Taee, 29.As part of a new generation of archaeologists, Mr. al-Taee works for the Iraqi government on a World Monuments Fund project aimed at stemming the damage to one of the world’s best known — yet least understood — archaeological sites.After years of Iraqi effort, Babylon was inscribed two years ago as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, recognizing the exceptional universal cultural value of what was considered the most dazzling metropolis in the ancient world.
