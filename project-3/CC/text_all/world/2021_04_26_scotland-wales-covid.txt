Stores, beauty salons, museums and galleries also reopened, and people are permitted to book travel in the rest of Britain.The first minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, said she was hopeful that the country would continue its progress and lift more restrictions by the summer. But she cautioned that the virus was more infectious now than it had been in earlier waves and, therefore, “We must stick to the rules.” Free rapid tests will be available to the public.In Wales, places of worship and retail stores reopened, and restaurants resumed outdoor service.
