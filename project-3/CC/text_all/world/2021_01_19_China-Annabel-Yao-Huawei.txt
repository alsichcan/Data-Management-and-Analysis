A Child of China’s Gilded Elite Strikes a Nerve Over Wealth and Privilege
Annabel Yao is a fresh-faced college graduate with big dreams. She wants to be an entertainer and is putting in the work to make it happen.She is also a member of China’s rarefied elite, the younger daughter of the billionaire founder and chairman of the telecommunications giant Huawei who proclaimed her debut at a time when China seems to have turned on its many high-flying tycoons.So when Ms. Yao, 23, launched a highly polished publicity blitz last week — including a 17-minute “making of” documentary, a magazine cover and a music video — the response was savage.Ms. Yao’s tone — opining about her social status, her struggles, her up-by-the-bootstrap pluck — seemed to strike a nerve in a country that is still emerging from a public health crisis and an economy that has left millions out of work, even as the country itself broadly recovers.
