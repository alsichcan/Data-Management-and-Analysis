As Jordan Seeks to Quell Royal Feud, Allies of Prince Remain in Detention
AMMAN, Jordan — Employees and associates of a Jordanian prince accused of plotting to undermine the government were still being held incommunicado by security forces on Tuesday, their relatives said, casting doubt on earlier claims by the royal court that it had resolved an unusually public and bitter rift.The royal court released a statement on Monday saying that the prince, Hamzah bin Hussein, had pledged his loyalty to King Abdullah II, his older half brother. But Prince Hamzah’s chief of staff, Yasser Majali, and Mr. Majali’s cousin, Samir Majali, are still being held in an unknown location, according to their family, which comes from one of Jordan’s main tribes.The two were among 18 people arrested on Saturday, the day that the government claimed that the prince had been involved in a plot to destabilize the kingdom’s stability.“Every time we call someone, they say we will get back to you,” said Abdullah Majali, Yasser’s brother, in an account corroborated by a second senior member of the Majali family. “We still don’t know where they are.”
