Shamima Begum Loses Effort to Return to U.K. in Fight for Citizenship
LONDON — Shamima Begum, who as a schoolgirl left her London home to join the Islamic State in Syria in 2015, lost a series of appeals before Britain’s Supreme Court on Friday that could have allowed her to return home to fight the removal of her citizenship, a move that could affect other British citizens held in detention camps in Syria.Ms. Begum, now 21, hoped to return to Britain to appeal a 2019 decision by the British government to strip her of her citizenship, a move that could render her stateless. A lower court ruled last year that Ms. Begum could only be granted a “fair and effective appeal” by returning to Britain, but on Friday, the Supreme Court’s five judges unanimously denied her request to return.“The right to a fair hearing does not trump all other considerations, such as the safety of the public,” said Robert Reed, a Supreme Court judge. “If a vital public interest makes it impossible for a case to be fairly heard, then the courts cannot ordinarily hear it.”The ruling could have far-reaching implications for other Westerners associated with the terrorist group who have remained in detention camps in northeastern Syria. That includes about 15 other British women who have also been stripped of their citizenship. Some, like Ms. Begum, have pleaded with the authorities to repatriate them so they could be prosecuted at home.
