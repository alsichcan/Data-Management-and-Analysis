New Zealand to Roll Out Free Period Products to All Students
AUCKLAND, New Zealand — Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Thursday that all schools would make free menstrual products available to students for the next three years, adding New Zealand to the global effort to reduce “period poverty” — a lack of access to pads or tampons that could negatively affect education, health or employment.The announcement came after a six-month pilot program involving 3,200 students across 15 schools in the country’s Waikato region. The national initiative, which will begin in June at primary, intermediate and secondary schools, is expected to cost 25 million New Zealand dollars ($17.96 million), Ms. Ardern said.“Young people should not miss out on their education because of something that is a normal part of life for half the population,” she said outside a school in the city of Hamilton.In November, Scotland became the first country to announce that it would make period products freely available to all who need them. Other countries have taken smaller steps toward addressing period inequity.
