Why Germany Prosecutes the Aged for Nazi Roles It Long Ignored
BERLIN — The woman charged last week was 94 and had worked as a secretary. This week, German prosecutors charged a 100-year-old man who had worked as a guard, like the man convicted last year, aged 93.These three Germans are part of a diminishing ripple of criminal prosecutions related to the Nazi war crimes of last century. Not only are the defendants ever-more aged than those tried in past decades, but they are also less likely to have had a direct role in the atrocities committed in their proximity decades ago, and some were underage at the time.Now they have been caught up in Germany’s race against the clock to bring the final members of the Nazi generation to justice. Some Germans have pushed back against their country’s attempts, however late, to serve justice on those who helped perpetuate some of the 20th Century’s worst crimes, but others say the rise of a new far right has made the prosecutions more important than ever.“It took a long time, which has not made things any easier, because now we are dealing with such elderly defendants,” said Cyrill Klement, a prosecutor in Neuruppin, whose office pressed charges against the 100-year-old man. “But murder and accessory to murder have no statute of limitation.”
