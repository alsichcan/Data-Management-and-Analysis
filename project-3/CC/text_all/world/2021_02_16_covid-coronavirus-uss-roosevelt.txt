Three sailors test positive aboard U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, site of spring outbreak, officials say.
Three sailors aboard the U.S.S. Theodore Roosevelt, an aircraft carrier that was the center of a contentious outbreak last spring, have tested positive for the coronavirus, according to Navy officials.The sailors, who tested positive on Sunday, were not experiencing any symptoms and were placed in isolation on the ship, which remained “fully operational,” the Navy said in a statement on Monday.“The ship is following an aggressive mitigation strategy in accordance with Navy and C.D.C. guidelines to include mandatory mask wearing, social distancing, and proper hygiene and sanitation practices,” the statement said.Last March, the Theodore Roosevelt docked at the naval base in Guam, an American territory in the Pacific, as it contended with a fast-spreading outbreak among its crew of 4,800. For weeks the warship battled the virus that infected at least 585 crew members, including one who died of complications stemming from the coronavirus.
