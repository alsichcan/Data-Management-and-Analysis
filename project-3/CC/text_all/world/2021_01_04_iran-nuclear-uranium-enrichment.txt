Iran Increases Uranium Enrichment at Key Nuclear Facility
Iran announced on Monday that it had increased its uranium enrichment levels, bringing it closer to developing the capacity to produce a nuclear weapon within six months.The resumption of enrichment to 20 percent was the latest in a series of escalations that have followed President Trump’s decision to withdraw the United States from a 2015 nuclear agreement that had limited Iran to enrichment levels of 4 to 5 percent.In another provocation, Iran seized a South Korean chemical tanker, citing “environmental and chemical pollution concerns,” the semiofficial Tasmin News Agency reported. The seizure of the vessel, confirmed by the South Korean government, comes as Tehran is pressuring Seoul to release $7 billion in funds frozen because of United States sanctions.
