As U.S. tops 4,000 deaths in a day, a record, Fauci warns that January will get harder.
Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the top infectious disease expert in the United States, predicted on Thursday that the daily death toll from the coronavirus would continue to rise for weeks to come, and counseled patience with the vaccination program gearing up across the nation.Hours later, officials across the United States reported yet another daily record for deaths, over 4,000. The total for the pandemic in the U.S. has surpassed 365,400.In an interview with NPR, Dr. Fauci said the high toll was likely to continue, and was probably a reflection of increased travel and gatherings over the holidays.“We believe things will get worse as we get into January,” he said.He stressed that it was still possible to “blunt that acceleration” by strictly adhering to public health measures like social distancing and mask wearing.
