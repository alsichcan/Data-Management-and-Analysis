Love or Spycraft: What Landed an American Teacher in a Cuban Prison?
MIAMI — A secret marriage. A cryptic phone call. And then, a flight to Cuba from which Alina López Miyares never returned.It was months later that her family learned that Ms. López, a dual Cuban and American citizen living in Miami, had gotten entangled in a murky love story steeped in international espionage. Now 62, she is serving a 13-year sentence in a Cuban prison. Her closed trial in a military court lasted a single morning.To the Cuban government, which made its case in court documents reviewed by The New York Times, she is a traitor and a spy who slipped the names of Cuban operatives to the F.B.I.To her family and her supporters in the United States, she is a guileless woman who was duped by an old flame — a Cuban diplomat and spy — and misguided by American intelligence agents. She’s been detained since 2017, and they want the U.S. government to help bring her back.
