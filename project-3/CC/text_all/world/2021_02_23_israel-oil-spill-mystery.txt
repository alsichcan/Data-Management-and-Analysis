Israel’s Beaches Are Littered With Tar After Mysterious Oil Spill
JERUSALEM — A large oil spill from an unknown source has devastated sea life in the Mediterranean and spewed tons of tar across more than 100 miles of coastline from Israel to southern Lebanon in what Israeli officials are calling one of the worst ecological disasters in decades.Shaul Goldstein, the director of Israel’s nature and parks authority, said the spill would set back three decades of efforts to protect and renew biodiversity along the coastline.“I feel like I want to cry,” said Mr. Goldstein, who has spent the past several days removing tar from the beaches. “It’s everywhere — it’s even four to five inches thick in some places.”Israeli authorities said they are investigating the cause of the spill, which the environmental protection ministry said it only learned about when thick clumps of tar showed up on beaches last Wednesday, prompting an enormous cleanup effort to try to mitigate the damage.
