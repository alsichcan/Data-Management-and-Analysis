Myanmar’s Leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, Is Detained Amid Coup
BANGKOK — Myanmar’s military launched a coup on Monday, detaining the country’s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, and her top lieutenants in early morning raids and seizing power from a government established only five years ago.Officials from the National League for Democracy, Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi’s party, confirmed the detentions on Monday morning. Hours later, with politicians and activists alike racing to find out who had been detained, a military television network announced a one-year state of emergency with ultimate authority transferred to the army chief, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing.State television broadcast a statement from the military later on Monday that said extreme steps were necessary because of what it labeled voter fraud in elections last November. Those polls had confirmed the National League for Democracy’s dominance over the military’s proxy party. In its statement, the military said that it will oversee free and fair multiparty elections after the end of the state of emergency.Mobile networks and the internet were intermittently down in major cities, and some local journalists went into hiding for fear that their reporting could compromise their safety. Domestic flights were suspended, and the main international airport in Yangon, the largest city in Myanmar, had been shuttered, according to residents.
