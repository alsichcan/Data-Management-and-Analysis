N.Y.C.’s subway system will start running longer into the night next week, officials say.
Subways in New York will soon resume running longer into the night, transit officials announced on Monday, marking a step toward the full reopening of city life.Starting next Monday, the system will close for cleaning only from 2 to 4 a.m., instead of from 1 to 5 a.m., officials said during a news conference. They described the move as the beginning of a “phased reopening,” although they did not say when trains would again operate around the clock.“New York is starting to return to normalcy,” said Sarah Feinberg, interim president of the New York City Transit Authority, which manages the subways.The regular overnight closure — the first in the system’s history — began last May, as the pandemic ripped through New York. Under Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which oversees transit in New York City, mandated the nightly closures of the famously 24-hour subway system to allow the entire system to be disinfected, a move Mr. Cuomo said was needed to reduce the spread of the virus.
