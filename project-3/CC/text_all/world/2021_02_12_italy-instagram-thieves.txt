Using Instagram and Acrobatics, Thieves Targeted V.I.P.s in Milan
Eleonora Incardona’s opulent posts of herself on the beach or dressed to the nines with chunky watches and golden necklaces were intended to catch the eye of her 470,000-plus followers on Instagram.But her meticulous documenting of the glamorous lifestyle of an internet influencer seems also to have grabbed some unwanted attention.On a Saturday in December, a group of thieves, dressed to blend in with Milan’s fashion set, watched as Ms. Incardona left her apartment building, where she stopped to make another Instagram video announcing that everyone, including her pet Chihuahua, Oliver, had left her home. The thieves could be confident that the coast was clear. They scaled the wall — with “circuslike” skill, the police said — and made off with Chanel and Louis Vuitton handbags and assorted jewels.And Ms. Incardona was apparently not the only victim.This week, the police in Milan arrested a group on suspicion of having taken tens of thousands of euros in watches, scarves, designer bags and jewels from the apartments of Milanese V.I.P.s.
