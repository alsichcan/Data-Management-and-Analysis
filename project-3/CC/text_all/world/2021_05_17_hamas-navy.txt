Israel is targeting Hamas naval forces. So what can Hamas do by sea?
When it comes to Hamasâ€™s military capabilities, much of the focus has been on the labyrinthine tunnels it uses to launch attacks against Israel or the arsenal of missiles it aims at Israeli cities.But Israeli military experts and officials say there is another, less-discussed and murkier threat: clandestine naval commandoes entering or hitting Israel by sea.It sounds like a scene from a Cold War thriller: An undercover commando unit infiltrating a country with underwater vessel in order to target an energy facility, a populated town, or wreak havoc in some other way.But that was possibly the goal, according to the Israeli military, of a naval unit being directed by Hamas.
