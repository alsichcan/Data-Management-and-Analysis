‘A Very Big Problem.’ Giant Ship in the Suez Remains Stuck.
[Update: After nearly a week, the Ever Given, the mammoth container ship stuck in the Suez Canal, has been freed.]MANSHIYET RUGOLA, Egypt — The gargantuan container ship that has blocked world trade by getting stuck aslant the Suez Canal has towered over Umm Gaafar’s dusty brick house for five days now, humming its deep mechanical hum.She looked up from where she sat in the bumpy dirt lane and considered what the vessel, the Ever Given, might be carrying in all those containers. Flat-screen TVs? Full-sized refrigerators, washing machines or ceiling fans? Neither she nor her neighbors in the village of Manshiyet Rugola, population 5,000-ish, had any of those at home.“Why don’t they pull out one of those containers?” joked Umm Gaafar, 65. “There could be something good in there. Maybe it could feed the town.”
