Anger Churns Over Police Tactics at Sarah Everard Vigil in London
LONDON — Her death shocked Britons and crystallized fears about the safety of women on British streets. But since the police on Saturday broke up a vigil for Sarah Everard, the 33-year-old marketing executive who was killed this month, those concerns have only grown, aggravated by questions about why women were grappled, forced to the ground and arrested in the South London park where the gathering in her memory took place.Although the vigil was officially canceled because the authorities had said that the plans violated social-distancing laws, hundreds showed up anyway, ultimately prompting officers to break up the gathering.But trying to disperse the crowds produced scenes that the British home secretary, Priti Patel, later described as “distressing and upsetting,” prompting demands for the resignation of the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Cressida Dick.While analysts blamed policing errors, they also pointed to flaws in coronavirus laws that give officers powers that would normally be unrivaled in peacetime — not only in scope but also in the vagueness of their potential application.
