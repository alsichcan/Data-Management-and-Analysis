In some cities, fear and uncertainty have settled over its hushed streets and shuttered storefronts, heavy with the knowledge that the pandemic may worsen before it gets better. And yet the people of India are finding ways to persevere. They are amplifying online pleas for hospital beds and oxygen. They are organizing food and supply runs for neighbors and others. They are hunkering down with their families until the crisis passes. They are surviving.The New York Times wants to hear the stories and share the images from a country under virtual lockdown. We want to see what you see and understand what you have endured, and we want to know what youâ€™re doing to comfort one another and pass the time until India can return to its bustle and vibrancy.
