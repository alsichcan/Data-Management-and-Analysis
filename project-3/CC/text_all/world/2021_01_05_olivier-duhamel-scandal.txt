Prominent French Intellectual Steps Down Amid Accusations of Incest
PARIS — In the latest of several scandals to test French attitudes toward sexual abuse of minors, a prominent political scientist, radio show host and television commentator has quit his media and university posts after being accused in a new book of committing incest with his teenage stepson more than 30 years ago.Olivier Duhamel, a French public intellectual, said in a Twitter post Monday that he had decided to step down as a result of “personal attacks” against him, and out of a determination to “preserve the institutions in which I work.” These included the Sciences Po university, where Mr. Duhamel, 70, headed the body overseeing the renowned Paris institution.Camille Kouchner, in a book called “La familia grande” to be published Thursday, said Mr. Duhamel persistently abused her twin brother, starting when he was 14, which would be considered incest under French law. In a statement to the daily Le Monde, the brother, who is identified in the book as “Victor,” said, “I confirm that what my sister has written about the actions of Olivier Duhamel toward me is correct.”Addressing Mr. Duhamel directly in the book, excerpts from which appeared in Le Monde, Ms. Kouchner writes: “I am going to explain to you who sound off on the radio, you who offer the gift of your analysis to students, and strut about on TV stages. I am going to explain that you could, at least, have said sorry.”
