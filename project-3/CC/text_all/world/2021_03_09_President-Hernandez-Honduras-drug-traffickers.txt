Honduran Leader Vowed to Help Flood U.S. With Cocaine, Prosecutor Says
President Juan Orlando Hernández of Honduras promised to protect drug traffickers using the nation’s security forces and law enforcement agencies, and to help them flood the United States with cocaine, an American prosecutor said on Tuesday.“They would — as the president put it — ‘shove the drugs right up the noses of the gringos,’” said the prosecutor, Jacob Harris Gutwillig, an assistant U.S. attorney in New York.The allegations emerged in Federal District Court in Manhattan during opening arguments in the trial of Geovanny Fuentes Ramírez, a Honduran accused of conspiring to import cocaine into the United States from Honduras, as well as of weapons charges.The trial is also something of a referendum on Mr. Hernández, who has been dogged for years by accusations of possible connections to drug traffickers. He has not been charged, but in court documents filed earlier this year, American prosecutors revealed for the first time that they were investigating the Honduran president.
