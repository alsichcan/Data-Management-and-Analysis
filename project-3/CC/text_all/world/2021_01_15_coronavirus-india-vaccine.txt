A Mix of Pride and Doubts as Modi Launches India’s Covid-19 Vaccine Drive
PUNE, India — India on Friday was preparing to launch one of the most ambitious and complex nationwide campaigns in its history: the rollout of coronavirus vaccines to 1.3 billion people, an undertaking that will stretch from the perilous reaches of the Himalayas to the dense jungles of the country’s southern tip.The toughest part might be persuading doubters like Shankar Patil to roll up their sleeves.Mr. Patil, a 27-year-old state police academy applicant, lives in Pune, the city central to India’s vaccine rollout, which is set to begin on Saturday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is staking his pride on India’s ability to manufacture enough inexpensive shots to inoculate his country as well as much of the developing world. India aims to do nothing less than “protect humanity,” Mr. Modi said at an online address to the Indian diaspora recently.Stretched out on an exercise mat along a row of pink Mexican lilacs at the top of Parvati, a hillock popular with early-morning joggers, Mr. Patil has questions. He and two friends, also aspiring police officers joining him to exercise, are skeptical about the country’s vaccine approval process, which has been criticized by health experts for a lack of disclosure.“We believe in the government, but nobody should play with our health,” said Mr. Patil. “If the vaccines are truly safe, they should make the data public.”
