In an Israeli city within Hamas’s reach, gratitude for the calm, but bracing for more fighting.
ASHKELON, Israel — Residents of Ashkelon, a coastal city barely a dozen miles north of Gaza, emerged gingerly from their houses on Friday — with the skies as calm as the nearby sea.For more than a week, the coastal city, which is within the range of rockets fired by Hamas, had been under siege.And even after four major conflicts between Israel and the militant groups in Gaza in the past 12 years — with the threat of rocket fire a familiar part of life — it is not something people would ever typically get used to.But this time, residents said, it was different. More furious and intense, with barrages of up to 40 rockets at a time.
