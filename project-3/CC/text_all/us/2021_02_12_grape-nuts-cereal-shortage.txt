Grape-Nuts Expected to Be Back on Store Shelves Next Month
After a monthslong, nationwide shortage of its polarizing cereal, the maker of Grape-Nuts is trying to reassure customers that the familiar wheat-and-barley breakfast will soon be back, still with no grapes or nuts.The cereal’s manufacturer, Post Consumer Brands, announced on Thursday that it would be shipping the cereal at full capacity by mid-March, after supply-chain constraints and higher demand during the pandemic caused a shortage in late 2020.“We recognize that the temporary Grape-Nuts shortage has been frustrating to fans given that Grape-Nuts is a one-of-a-kind cereal and there is no other cereal like it on the market,” Kristin DeRock, the cereal’s brand manager, said in a statement.She added, “We ramped up production and are running full swing 51 out of the next 55 days.”The shortage put loyal customers on edge and led to an outcry on social media, where fans expressed their frustration and told of the challenges they faced searching for the cereal.
