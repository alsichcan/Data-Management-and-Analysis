Gyms, movie theaters and museums, which have all been shuttered or allowed to operate only outside, will at last be able to open their doors in L.A., as well as in Orange, San Bernardino, Sonoma and nine other counties moving from the state’s most restrictive purple tier to the second most restrictive red tier in the state’s color-coded reopening framework.Another dozen counties are expected to meet the threshold for moving into the red tier on Tuesday, after the state loosened the rules in conjunction with an effort to vaccinate people in hard-hit, vulnerable communities.[Here’s everything you need to get caught up on California’s reopening.]On Thursday, President Biden marked the anniversary of the World Health Organization’s declaring of a pandemic.
