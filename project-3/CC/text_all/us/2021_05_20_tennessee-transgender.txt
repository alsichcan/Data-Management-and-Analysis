Tennessee Bans Hormone Treatments for Transgender Children
Tennessee approved a law this week that bans gender-confirming hormone treatments for prepubescent minors, the second state to enact such legislation affecting transgender youths.Gov. Bill Lee, a Republican, signed the Tennessee bill into law on Tuesday. It follows a measure approved earlier this year in Arkansas that prohibits such transition treatments and surgery for minors. In April, Gov. Asa Hutchinson — in a rare move for a Republican elected official — vetoed that legislation, though his veto was later overridden by the State Legislature.Unlike Arkansas’s law, Tennessee’s takes a narrower approach, banning doctors from giving the transition hormone treatments to prepubescent minors. It is among a series of measures focusing on transgender youths that have been enacted by Tennessee lawmakers this year.L.G.B.T.Q. advocates quickly condemned the new Tennessee law concerning hormone treatments, saying it addresses a nonexistent situation.
