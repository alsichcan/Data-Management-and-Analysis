Twelve Jurors Seated in Chauvin Case
MINNEAPOLIS — After eight days of intense questioning about political biases, racism and policing, 12 jurors have been seated for the trial of Derek Chauvin, the former police officer charged with two counts of murder for the death of George Floyd.The court now needs to select two alternates to round out the jury. Motions by Mr. Chauvin’s lawyer for a delay and to move the trial outside the Twin Cities are pending, possibly jeopardizing the scheduled start of opening statements on March 29.Judge Peter A. Cahill of Hennepin County District Court, who is overseeing the case, has said he would rule Friday on both matters. But, with the 12 jurors already seated, legal experts said it was unlikely he would, at this point, delay the proceedings or move the case to another jurisdiction.From the start, many worried that it would be impossible to seat an impartial jury in Minneapolis for a case that provoked wide-scale unrest and reverberated around the world, inspiring the largest mass movement for civil rights since the 1960s. Mr. Chauvin, who is white, kept his knee on the neck of Mr. Floyd, a Black man, for more than nine minutes on a street corner in South Minneapolis last May. As he lay pressed to the concrete, Mr. Floyd repeatedly said he could not breathe.
