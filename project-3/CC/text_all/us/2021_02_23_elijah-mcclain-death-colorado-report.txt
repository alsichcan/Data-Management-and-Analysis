Independent Report Criticizes Aurora Police in Elijah McClain’s Death
An independent panel investigating the death of a 23-year-old Black man who was detained in 2019 by the police in Aurora, Colo., issued a highly critical report on Monday faulting officers for stopping the man without justification and for escalating their use of force, including two applications of a neck hold intended to render him unconscious.The report’s authors criticized Fire Department paramedics as slow to help the man, Elijah McClain, before injecting him with an improper dose of ketamine, a tranquilizer. Mr. McClain went into cardiac arrest on the way to a hospital. He died a few days later.The panel also said that an investigation by local police detectives “raised serious concerns” for failing both to rigorously question the officers involved and to examine the circumstances of Mr. McClain’s death. In November 2019, three months after Mr. McClain’s death, the Adams County district attorney announced that criminal charges would not be filed, saying there was not enough evidence that the officers had broken the law when they used force on Mr. McClain.Aurora officials said that the purpose of the report, commissioned in July by the City Council, was to create a timeline of events, and to recommend policy changes in order to avoid further tragedies. It was written by Jonathan M. Smith, a civil rights lawyer in Washington, D.C.; Roberto A Villaseñor, a retired police chief from Tucson, Ariz.; and Dr. Melissa W. Costello, an emergency medicine expert in Pascagoula, Miss.
