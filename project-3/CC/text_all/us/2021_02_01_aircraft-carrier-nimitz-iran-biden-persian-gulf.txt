U.S. Aircraft Carrier Returning Home After Long Sea Tour Watching Iran
WASHINGTON — The aircraft carrier Nimitz is finally going home.The Pentagon last month ordered the warship to remain in the Middle East because of Iranian threats against President Donald J. Trump and other American officials, just three days after announcing the ship was returning home as a signal to de-escalate rising tensions with Tehran.With those immediate tensions seeming to ease a bit, and President Biden looking to renew discussions with Iran on the 2015 nuclear accord that Mr. Trump withdrew from, three Defense Department officials said on Monday that the Nimitz and its 5,000-member crew were ordered on Sunday to return to the ship’s home port of Bremerton, Wash., after a longer-than-usual 10-month deployment.The Pentagon for weeks had been engaged in a muscle-flexing strategy aimed at deterring Iran and its Shia proxies in Iraq from attacking American personnel in the Persian Gulf to avenge the death of Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani. General Suleimani, the commander of Iran’s elite Quds Force of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, was killed in an American drone strike in January 2020.The Pentagon then asserted last month — without presenting any evidence — that it had detected new intelligence that Iran was targeting Mr. Trump in the weeks before the inauguration. So the Nimitz and its wing of strike aircraft were ordered to stay near the Persian Gulf, just in case.
