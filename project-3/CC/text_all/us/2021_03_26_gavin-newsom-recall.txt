Who Are Gavin Newsom’s Enemies?
For Democratic officials aiming at higher office, California’s top political jobs have appeared to be the perfect launchpad.This year, Kamala Harris went from representing the Golden State in the Senate to becoming the vice president. Alex Padilla, California’s secretary of state, was appointed to take Ms. Harris’s old job. And Xavier Becerra left his post as the state’s attorney general to become President Biden’s secretary of health and human services — always a big job, but especially so for an administration focused on confronting the coronavirus pandemic and strengthening the Affordable Care Act.But there’s one big exception to this trend, and it’s at the very top of the state government. Gov. Gavin Newsom, 53, who less than a year ago appeared to have one of the brightest futures of any Democratic politician in the country, is fighting just to keep his job, amid a largely Republican-led recall effort that has already submitted more than two million signatures.If roughly 1.5 million of those signatures are found to be valid, the state will move ahead with a vote to recall the governor and replace him. Already, about half a dozen candidates have filed to run in the event of a recall election.
