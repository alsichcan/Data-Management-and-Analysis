Joe Neguse: Impeachment Manager Was Early Advocate of Charging President
WASHINGTON — Nearly four decades ago, Representative Joe Neguse’s parents fled Eritrea and came to the United States as refugees, eventually settling in Colorado to raise their son and daughter.Now Mr. Neguse, Democrat of Colorado and the first African-American to represent the state, will be an impeachment manager, presenting the case for President Trump’s removal from office before the Senate.“If Congress does not act,” he told colleagues on Wednesday on the House floor before the impeachment vote, “if we shrink from our constitutional responsibilities to defend our republic, it will undoubtedly undermine the vision of America as the last best hope of earth,” quoting Abraham Lincoln.In an interview after the House impeached Mr. Trump for the second time, Mr. Neguse evoked his parents as he spoke about “the need to secure those freedoms that have given so many so much.”
