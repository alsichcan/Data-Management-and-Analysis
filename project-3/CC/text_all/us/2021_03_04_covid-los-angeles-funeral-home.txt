‘A Nightmare Every Day’: Inside an Overwhelmed Funeral Home
LOS ANGELES — The chapel at Continental Funeral Home was once a place where the living remembered the dead. Now the pews, chairs and furniture have been pushed aside to make room, and the dead far outnumber the living.On a Thursday afternoon last month in Continental’s chapel in East Los Angeles, across the street from a 7-Eleven, there were four bodies in cardboard boxes.And two bodies in open coffins, awaiting makeup.And seven wrapped in white and pink sheets on wheeled stretchers.And 18 in closed coffins where the pews used to be.And 31 on the shelves of racks against the walls.The math numbed the heart as much as the mind — 62 bodies.Elsewhere at Continental — in the hallways beyond the chapel, in the trailers outside — there were even more.“I live a nightmare every day,” said Magda Maldonado, 58, the owner of the funeral home. “It’s a crisis, a deep crisis. When somebody calls me, I beg them for patience. ‘Please be patient,’ I say, ‘that’s all I’m asking you.’ Because nothing is normal these days.”
