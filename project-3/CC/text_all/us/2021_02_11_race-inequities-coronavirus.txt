‘Race and Place Matter’: A Biden Adviser Tackles Coronavirus Inequities
WASHINGTON — President Biden has said repeatedly that racial equity will be at the core of his coronavirus response. Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith is in charge of making that happen.A Yale epidemiologist who grew up in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Dr. Nunez-Smith is the chairwoman of Mr. Biden’s coronavirus equity task force, charged with advising the president on how to allocate resources and reach out to underserved populations to fight a pandemic that has taken a devastating toll on people of color.Black and Latino people have been nearly twice as likely as white people to die from Covid-19. Though data on disparities in vaccination are incomplete, early reports from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that while Black people make up more than 13 percent of the U.S. population, just 5.4 percent of vaccine recipients are Black. Latinos make up 18.5 percent of the population but are 11.5 percent of those vaccinated.“Make no mistake about it — beating this pandemic is hard work,” Dr. Nunez-Smith told reporters on Wednesday, after the White House named the members of the task force. “And beating this pandemic while making sure that everyone in every community has a fair chance to stay safe or to regain their health, well, that’s the hard work and the right work.”
