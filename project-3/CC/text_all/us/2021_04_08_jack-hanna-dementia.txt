Celebrity Zookeeper Jack Hanna Has Dementia, His Family Says
Jack Hanna, the affable zookeeper and television fixture who has brought a panoply of exotic animals into Americans’ living rooms, from an Andean condor to a wolverine, has dementia and will retire from public life, his family said.In a letter shared Wednesday on social media, the family of the 74-year-old Mr. Hanna said that he had developed what is believed to be Alzheimer’s disease and that his condition had deteriorated rapidly in the past few months.“Sadly, Dad is no longer able to participate in public life as he used to, where people all over the world watched, learned and laughed alongside him,” Mr. Hanna’s three daughters said in the letter.Last year, the Columbus Zoo and Aquarium in Ohio announced that Mr. Hanna would retire from his leadership role there after 42 years as director and director emeritus.
