Democrats scramble to salvage a minimum wage proposal ahead of the House vote on Biden’s stimulus plan.
A day after a key Senate official ruled that a provision increasing the federal minimum wage would need to be removed as written from President Biden’s $1.9 trillion stimulus plan, Democrats were scrambling to salvage the critical progressive priority.While the House is expected on Friday to move forward with a vote on the minimum-wage language as part of the full package, Senate Democrats were exploring how to codify their push to gradually raise the wage to $15 by 2025 without violating Senate rules.Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the majority leader, and other top Democrats are examining adding a provision that would penalize corporations that don’t pay workers at least a $15 minimum wage, a senior Democratic aide said on Friday. Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said he was also examining legislation that would impose tax penalties on companies if any workers earn less than a certain amount.In order to have the stimulus package become law before unemployment benefits begin to lapse in mid-March, Democrats are rushing the legislation through Congress on a fast-track process known as budget reconciliation, which shields it from a filibuster in the Senate, allowing it to pass without Republican support.
