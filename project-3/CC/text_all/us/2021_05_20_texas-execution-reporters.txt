Texas’ First Execution in Nearly a Year Had No Reporters Present
SAN ANTONIO — A Texas man convicted of killing an older relative 22 years ago was put to death on Wednesday evening in Huntsville, Texas, as a spiritual adviser assigned to him and a witness from the public looked on.Absent were two journalists who had been scheduled to attend the execution but whom prison officials said they had accidentally failed to summon.The reporters, from The Associated Press and The Huntsville Item, a local outlet, were waiting at an office across the street as the man, Quintin Jones, was executed by lethal injection. Mr. Jones, 41, whose case had garnered national attention as his family pleaded for clemency, was the 571st person to be executed in Texas and the first in the state in nearly a year. He was convicted of the 1999 murder of his great-aunt Berthena Bryant.Supporters of Mr. Jones expressed grief that clemency efforts had failed. Critics of the death penalty and civil liberty groups also denounced the fact that media outlets had not been granted access. Reporters traditionally cover executions to provide accountability to the public about the process; they have sometimes brought details of problems to light, including a faulty lethal injection in Oklahoma in 2014.
