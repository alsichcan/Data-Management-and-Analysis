Gavin Newsom, California’s governor, enlists progressive stars to fight an effort to recall him.
Gov. Gavin Newsom of California has enlisted a roster of progressive powerhouses — including Stacey Abrams, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders — to fight a recall effort by Republicans enraged by the state’s lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic.On Monday, allies of Mr. Newsom announced the creation of a new fund-raising arm and website, stoptherepublicanrecall.com, that is allowed to raise virtually unlimited donations under state law. The creation of the group, Democrats said, was a tacit admission that the measure will garner enough signatures to be on the ballot later this year.“I won’t be distracted by this partisan, Republican recall — but I will fight it,” wrote Mr. Newsom in a Twitter post on Monday. Ms. Abrams, Ms. Warren, Mr. Sanders and the state’s new senator, Alex Padilla, joined other national Democrats to throw their support behind Mr. Newsom in a campaign already seen as a cash-attracting dry run for the 2022 midterms.
