Polling’s Prognosis: Wary Conservatives and Eager Liberals
Political pollsters know they’re having trouble reaching entire swaths of the Trump-supporting electorate, and they’re working on ways to address it.But some of them fear that might not even be the extent of the problem, and a report released today by Data for Progress, a left-leaning think tank and polling firm, bolsters that view.Data for Progress researchers have gotten used to being told to take a hike — and worse — by Trump supporters they try to poll, and the report detailed their difficulties in reaching that group.But perhaps most significantly, it also found that they were having trouble reaching a representative sample of Democrats, as well as Republicans — partly because liberals with strong political views were almost too willing to be polled.
