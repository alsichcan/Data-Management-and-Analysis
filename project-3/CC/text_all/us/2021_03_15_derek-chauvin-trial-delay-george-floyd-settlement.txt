Derek Chauvin’s lawyer asks for a delay in the trial.
MINNEAPOLIS — Expressing grave concern that the City of Minneapolis’s $27 million settlement with the family of George Floyd last week will tarnish his client, the lawyer for Derek Chauvin asked the judge on Monday to delay the trial and move it outside of the city.The lawyer, Eric J. Nelson, also asked that the seven jurors previously picked to serve on the case be brought back in for further questioning.“The fact this came in the middle of jury selection is perplexing,” Mr. Nelson told Judge Peter A. Cahill.Judge Cahill agreed that the settlement could affect the criminal case, saying he would consider a postponement. He said the timing was “unfortunate.”
