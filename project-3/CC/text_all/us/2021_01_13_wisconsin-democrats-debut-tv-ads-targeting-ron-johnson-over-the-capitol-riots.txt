Wisconsin Democrats debut TV ads targeting Ron Johnson over the Capitol riots.
The first television advertisements of the 2022 campaign cycle are on the air in Wisconsin, targeting a Republican senator and connecting him to last week’s violent riot at the U.S. Capitol.The Democratic Party of Wisconsin on Wednesday morning began a week’s worth of ads criticizing Senator Ron Johnson for his role in fomenting doubts about President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory in the presidential election and linking him to the siege at the Capitol.With gruesome images of a Capitol Police officer being crushed by rioters supporting President Trump, the ad’s narrator cites an editorial published last week in The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that called Mr. Johnson “a leading member of the Senate’s Sedition Caucus” and called for his resignation.The state party is spending more than $100,000 to air the ad in five Wisconsin TV markets and Washington, D.C., according to Ben Wikler, the Wisconsin Democratic chairman. It plans to keep the spot on television through Mr. Biden’s inauguration next week.
