White House Says Undocumented Students Can Receive Pandemic Aid
WASHINGTON — The Biden administration said on Tuesday that undocumented students could receive some of the $36 billion in emergency stimulus aid flowing to colleges, reversing a Trump-era policy that barred them from earlier rounds of funding that could help cover necessities.Miguel Cardona, the education secretary, told reporters during a phone call on Monday that a final rule issued through the Education Department would not require colleges to consider students’ immigration status when determining their need for federal grants that could pay for basics like food and housing.According to the rule, the Biden administration determined that doing so would create “significant additional roadblocks and delays” in issuing the grants.“What it does is really simplify the definition of a student,” Mr. Cardona said. “It makes it easier for colleges to administer the program and get money in the hands of students sooner.”
