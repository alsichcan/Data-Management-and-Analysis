Biden Won’t Budge on the Senate Filibuster. Why Aren’t Progressives Pushing Him?
President Biden has moved swiftly in his first days to start carrying out his agenda, signing executive orders and outlining new actions meant to lift the economy, combat climate change and close the racial wealth gap. But his most significant move may in fact be a reaffirmation of an old stance — that the Senate should protect the filibuster, the 60-vote threshold that has for years stymied expansive legislation, including on issues he now seeks to address.Progressive grumbling over the filibuster rose this week after Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, initially refused to agree to basic operating rules for the chamber unless Democrats agreed to maintain the procedural tactic. But it remained just a grumble, reflecting progressives’ desire to avoid intraparty warfare early in Mr. Biden’s term and their belief, shared more widely in Washington, that his hand may eventually be forced.Some argue that Mr. Biden, and Senate holdouts, will warm to the idea once Republicans block a popular piece of legislation, like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, named for the civil rights hero who died last year. Others think that Mr. Biden’s desire to be seen as a transformational president will overwhelm his instincts as a bedrock Washington traditionalist.“We have to recognize that the Senate has fundamentally changed from the time President Biden served,” said Senator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, a progressive who has endorsed eliminating the filibuster. “And it’s made it impossible to move forward on big issues.”
