Chicago Teachers Tentatively Agree to Return to Classrooms
The Chicago Teachers Union has reached a tentative deal with Mayor Lori Lightfoot to partially reopen the city’s schools for in-person classes starting this week, the mayor announced on Sunday.If it is finalized, the agreement would avert a strike that had threatened to disrupt instruction for students in the nation’s third largest school system. It would also allow students in prekindergarten through eighth grade, plus some high school students with severe disabilities, to return to classrooms, albeit on a slower schedule than the mayor had originally wanted.Almost all of the city’s 340,000 public school students have been studying remotely since March.Ms. Lightfoot, a Democrat, acknowledged on Sunday that the bitter fight with the union had been particularly hard on parents. But she asserted that what the city had achieved was vitally important, calling public education “the great equalizer.”“With our school reopening, we have taken a momentous step forward in our journey of renewal and recovery,” she said. “We can judge the health of who we are by what we do to support our children.”
