South Dakota Attorney General Faces Impeachment and Calls to Resign Over Crash
Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota on Tuesday called on the state’s attorney general to resign, as lawmakers started impeachment proceedings against him and officials released videos of police interviews about the night he struck and killed a man with his car last year.The attorney general, Jason R. Ravnsborg, who initially told the authorities that he had hit something that he believed was most likely a deer, has rebuffed the mounting pressure to resign.Mr. Ravnsborg was charged last week with careless driving, using a mobile electronic device and failing to stay in his lane on the night of the crash last September. The charges are misdemeanors, and each carries a penalty of up to 30 days in jail and a $500 fine.Ms. Noem urged people to watch the videos released by the state, which show the attorney general being confronted by investigators, including one who makes a stark assertion about the victim’s impact, telling him, “We know that his face came through your windshield.”
