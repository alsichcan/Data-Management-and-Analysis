In Home District, McCarthy Faces Some Backlash From the Right
BAKERSFIELD, Calif. — As Congress prepared to vote on impeachment for a second time, David Bynum reached out to his former boss — Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican leader in the House.Mr. Bynum, 38, was a college intern for Mr. McCarthy more than 16 years ago, when Mr. McCarthy was a rising star in the State Assembly in Sacramento. Mr. Bynum called and texted campaign and D.C. office staffers to urge him, from one Bakersfield Republican to another, to vote to impeach President Trump. A lawyer whose father is a prominent local developer, Mr. Bynum wanted Mr. Trump’s behavior condemned for the history books.He later asked a campaign staffer how many other calls supporting impeachment Mr. McCarthy was getting from Bakersfield Republicans. “Very few,’’ he was told. “They said, ‘We’re getting way more calls from people who are upset that he’s not doing more to support Donald Trump,’” Mr. Bynum said.
