Billions (Yes, Billions) of Cicadas Soon to Emerge From Underground
A few months of quarantine during the coronavirus pandemic? Thatâ€™s nothing for a swarm of cicadas that have been underground since 2004.In the time that the United States has seen the Boston Red Sox break an 86-year World Series drought, five presidential elections, a deadly pandemic and an insurrection, these creatures have been minding their own business, burrowed in the soil.Now billions of cicadas, from a group known as Brood X, are expected to emerge in the next few weeks, just in time to help orchestrate the soundtrack of summer.Brood X is one of several groups of periodical cicadas that emerge from beneath the ground every 17 years. Other cicadas have 13-year life cycles.
