Biden Seeks Update for a Much-Stretched Law That Authorizes the War on Terrorism
WASHINGTON — President Biden wants to work with Congress to repeal and replace a war authorization law passed shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, White House officials said on Friday. That law has been stretched across four administrations to permit open-ended combat against Islamist militant groups scattered across the world.The Biden administration is committed to working with Congress “to ensure that the authorizations for the use of military force currently on the books are replaced with a narrow and specific framework that will ensure we can protect Americans from terrorist threats while ending the forever wars,” Mr. Biden’s press secretary, Jen Psaki, said in a statement.But her statement stopped short of endorsing any particular proposal for how to overhaul the 2001 law, which is known as the Authorization for Use of Military Force, or A.U.M.F.Congress has for years struggled to reach any consensus about that question.The wording and intent of the 2001 law have grown increasingly detached from how the American government is using it. The law authorized war against the perpetrators of the Sept. 11 attacks and those who harbored them — essentially, the original Al Qaeda and its Taliban hosts.
