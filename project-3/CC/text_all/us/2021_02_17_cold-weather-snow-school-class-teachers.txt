Cold Interrupts Classes, in an Interrupted Year
For teachers and students, the brutal storm that burst pipes, disabled power grids and left usually temperate cities coated in snow and ice has further derailed an uncertain school year across much of the South and Midwest.“Our students have now lost an additional three, and it could be five, days of learning,” said Grenita Lathan, the interim superintendent in Houston. “And we were already behind.”Much of Houston is without power, and many of the district’s 25,000 staff members and 196,000 families cannot log on to remote classrooms. About 44 percent of students had attended in-person school, while the rest were fully remote. Amid blackouts, the district canceled classes until at least Thursday.“We had to deal with the pandemic,” Lathan said. “Now we’re dealing with a snow and ice storm, but everyone continues to bounce back.”
