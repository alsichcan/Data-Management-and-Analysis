A police officer was among the 10 dead.
Among the 10 people who died in the attack was Eric Talley, an 11-year veteran of the Boulder Police Department, who was described as “heroic” by Chief Maris Herold at a news conference at the scene of the shooting on Monday.“He was the first on the scene, and he was fatally shot,” Chief Herold said, holding back tears. “My heart goes out to the victims of this incident. And I’m grateful to the police officers that responded. And I am so sorry about the loss of Officer Talley.”“He was by all accounts one of the outstanding officers of the Boulder Police Department, and his life was cut far too short,” said Michael Dougherty, the Boulder County district attorney.
