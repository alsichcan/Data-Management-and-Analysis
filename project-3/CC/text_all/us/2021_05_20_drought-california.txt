Where’s the Water? Drought Threatens California’s Lifeline
Good morning.Even as California moves toward a full reopening from pandemic restrictions next month, many counties are still in danger.From drought.Earlier this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom extended emergency drought orders to 41 counties across the state. According to the United States Drought Monitor, 84 percent of the West is now in drought conditions, with 47 percent rated as “severe” or “extreme.” In California, 73 percent of the state falls into those categories. And if the recent Palisades fire in western Los Angeles is any indication, an active wildfire season could already be here.All eyes are on the critical resource that can help fight the effects of another dry summer: water.California relies on wet years to replenish its water supply during dry years. And while 2019 was a flood year, it has been dry since.The state’s drought from 2012 to 2016 set a new benchmark, Jeffrey Mount, a senior fellow with the Public Policy Institute of California’s Water Policy Center, told me this week. “That drought was significant because it was not only dry, with very limited snowpack, but it was the warmest in recorded history. The current drought — now two years old — is shaping up in the same way.”
