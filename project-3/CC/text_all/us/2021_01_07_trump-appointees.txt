After Delays and Tumult, Trump Tells Political Appointees to Submit Resignations
[Here’s what you need to know about President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s Inauguration Day.]WASHINGTON — The White House formally asked for the resignations of its ambassadors and other political appointees on Thursday as a wave of senior officials announced their departure from the government after President Trump incited supporters who had assaulted the Capitol a day earlier.The storming of the Capitol to disrupt the official Electoral College tally on Wednesday sent shock waves across the United States and around the world, and prompted Mr. Trump to promise early Thursday that he would ensure an “orderly transition” to the administration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.Hours after Mr. Trump conceded the reality of Mr. Biden’s victory, the White House issued a demand for the resignations of most of the estimated 4,000 political appointees working in the Trump administration, including cabinet secretaries, ambassadors and other policy advisers. That normally routine step for presidential administrations is usually issued within a few weeks of the election; the latest in recent times was in December 2008, near the end of President George W. Bush’s term.Mr. Trump, who had disputed the election outcome at a rally on Wednesday, had resisted sending the order until Thursday.
