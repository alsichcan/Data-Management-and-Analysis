Durbin, New Judiciary Chair, Warns Republicans on Blocking Judges
WASHINGTON — After nearly four decades in Congress, Senator Richard J. Durbin finally presided over a full committee hearing as chairman last week, gaveling the Judiciary Committee to order to consider the nomination of Judge Merrick B. Garland to be attorney general.It was a crowning moment for Mr. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois. With his party gaining the Senate majority, he took the reins of a panel that handles the issues that have driven his congressional career: judicial nominations, federal courts, immigration, criminal justice and civil rights, to name a few. Mr. Durbin, who is also the No. 2 Senate Democrat, sat for an interview in his leadership suite in the Capitol to answer questions on those topics and more.Offering a warning to Republicans on judges, Mr. Durbin said he would reserve the right to end their ability to block district court nominees through the arcane “blue slip” process — which allows senators to bless or blackball nominees from their home states — if he concluded that they were obstructing nominations without legitimate grounds.That would represent the latest diminution in the power of minority senators in the judicial wars, and it would also ease the Biden administration’s path to confirming district court judges in states with Republican senators.
