Man Says He Lived in Philadelphia’s Veterans Stadium for Years
PHILADELPHIA — Like other Vietnam veterans in the 1970s, Tom Garvey chased one job after another, fending off memories. Unlike other veterans, he says he turned a concession stand in a major American stadium into a place to crash for three years.The venue was Veterans Stadium, capacity some 60,000, home to two professional teams and, partly, where Philadelphia fans earned an infamous reputation as either the best worst fans or the worst best fans in the United States.For Mr. Garvey, now 78, it was also a home, a community and a kind of purgatory as he adapted to life after war. He has detailed his years as a secret stadium dweller, from 1979 into 1981, in a self-published book, “The Secret Apartment,” and The Philadelphia Inquirer reported his story last week.In an interview at his home outside the city, in Ambler, Pa., Mr. Garvey, a retired real estate agent, said he took no photos of the room because he feared being caught by the authorities or, worse, the uncles who got him a job running the stadium’s parking lots. The concession stand, like the rest of Veterans Stadium, was demolished in 2004.
