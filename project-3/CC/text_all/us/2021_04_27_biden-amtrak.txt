‘Amtrak Joe’ will travel to Pa. to sell his infrastructure plan and celebrate his favorite mode of transportation.
President Biden will travel on Friday to attend Amtrak’s 50th anniversary celebration in Philadelphia where he will promote his infrastructure plan and celebrate his signature mode of transportation, the White House announced on Tuesday.As a senator, Mr. Biden commuted between his home in Wilmington, Del., and Union Station in Washington, D.C., nearly every day Congress was in session. He also took the train, from time to time, as vice president, to the surprise of commuters alerted by a coterie of tense Secret Service agents who never seemed sure the trip was a good idea.It is a familiar venue for the president, who was born in Scranton, Pa., and headquartered his campaign within walking distance of Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station, where the anniversary event will take place.Mr. Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris will be crisscrossing the country following Wednesday’s speech before a joint session of Congress, and the Amtrak trip is intended, in part, to deflect criticism that his $2.3 trillion proposal includes too many social services programs unrelated to the traditional road-rail-and-sewer definition of infrastructure.
