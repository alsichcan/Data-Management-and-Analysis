‘I unequivocally condemn the violence,’ Trump says in a video, minutes after he is impeached.
Just after the House impeached him for inciting an insurrection against the United States government, President Trump issued a videotaped statement on Wednesday condemning the violent siege on the Capitol last week and urging his supporters not to riot again as President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. prepares to take office.In the video, released on YouTube and on the @WhiteHouse Twitter account, Mr. Trump did not concede that he had lost to Mr. Biden in a free and fair election or mention the president-elect by name, even as he used his strongest language yet to reject the violence carried out under his name.“I want to be very clear: I unequivocally condemn the violence that we saw last week,” Mr. Trump said. “Violence and vandalism have absolutely no place in our country and no place in our movement. Making America Great Again has always been about defending the rule of law,” and supporting law enforcement officials, Mr. Trump said.Security experts and law-enforcement officials have warned that a number of far-right groups have threatened demonstrations or attacks in the coming week.
