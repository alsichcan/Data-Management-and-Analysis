Chad Wolf has resigned as acting secretary for the Homeland Security Department.
Chad F. Wolf, the acting secretary for the Homeland Security Department, resigned on Monday, just nine days before he was expected to help coordinate the security of a presidential inauguration facing heightened threats of violence.Mr. Wolf told employees of the Homeland Security Department he would be stepping down on Monday night in part because of court rulings that invalidated some of the Trump administration’s immigration policies, citing the likelihood that Mr. Wolf was unlawfully appointed to lead the agency.“Unfortunately, this action is warranted by recent events, including the ongoing and meritless court rulings regarding the validity of my authority as Acting Secretary,” Mr. Wolf said in the letter obtained by The New York Times. “These events and concerns increasingly serve to divert attention and resources away from the important work of the Department in this critical time of a transition of power.”Mr. Wolf did not address the deadly siege of the Capitol in his letter. Peter T. Gaynor, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, will replace Mr. Wolf as the acting secretary of the Homeland Security Department. He will now be tasked with helping ensure the security of the inauguration of President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. The Secret Service, which falls under the Homeland Security Department, is leading the security efforts for the event.
