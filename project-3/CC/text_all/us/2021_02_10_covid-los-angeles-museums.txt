The Pandemic’s Toll on Los Angeles Museums
Good morning.(This article is part of the California Today newsletter. Sign up to get it delivered to your inbox.)Throughout the pandemic, cultural institutions of all kinds have been hammered by an ever-changing set of closures and compounding loss.That’s been particularly true in Los Angeles, by some measures the country’s worst-hit metropolis, where many indoor activities have been restricted for the better part of a year.My colleague Robin Pogrebin, who reports on cultural institutions, wrote about the toll of the pandemic on Los Angeles’s museums in this piece. She told us a little more about how she approached the story:Before the pandemic, I had arranged with my editors to spend a few months a year in Los Angeles, doing stories on the art world there and building sources so that I could better integrate West Coast news into my regular cultural coverage.
