The Country’s Evolving Marijuana Debate
Six years ago, when John Fetterman first ran for the Democratic Senate nomination in Pennsylvania, he spoke out about his support for legalizing marijuana. He was the only candidate to do so.But in just a few short years, the picture has changed.“The true crazy fringe perspective is ‘Reefer Madness’ now — the overwhelming majority of people want this,” Mr. Fetterman, now the state’s lieutenant governor, said in a phone interview on Tuesday. He was taking a brief pause between public events in celebration of April 20, a.k.a. 420, the unofficial national holiday for weed smokers.“People are over it already,” he added. “They’re like, ‘Why hasn’t this happened? What are we waiting for?’ Even Republicans.”
