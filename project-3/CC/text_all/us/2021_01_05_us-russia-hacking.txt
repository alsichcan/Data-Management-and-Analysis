Hacking ‘Likely’ Came From Russia, U.S. Says in Belated Statement
American intelligence agencies formally named Russia as the “likely” source of the broad hacking of the United States government and private companies, and declared that the operation was “ongoing” nearly a month after it was discovered.The statement jointly issued Tuesday by four government agencies was a clear rebuke of President Trump’s efforts, in posts on Twitter, to suggest that China was behind the hacking. Inside the intelligence agencies, there are few doubts that Russia is responsible. There has been no information gathered pointing to China, according to people briefed on the material.The statement also underscored the degree to which American intelligence agencies are still playing catch-up, after being alerted in mid-December by private security firms to the broadest and deepest penetration of American computer networks in recent times. The intelligence agencies have concluded with a high degree of confidence that Russia was responsible for the hacking, according to people briefed on the analysis.The statement is as definitive a blaming of Russia as the United States has yet made, and echoed the early statements in 2016 about the Kremlin’s interference in that year’s election. It took several additional months in that case for intelligence agencies to link the attacks back to orders given by President Vladimir V. Putin.
