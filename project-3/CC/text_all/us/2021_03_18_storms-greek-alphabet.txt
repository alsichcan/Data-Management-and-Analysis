The Greek Alphabet Will No Longer Be Used to Name Hurricanes
There will be no Hurricane Pi, Rho, Sigma or Tau.The Greek alphabet has been retired as a way of identifying tropical storms, the World Meteorological Organization said on Wednesday.The decision was made after nine Greek letters were pressed into service last year during the record-breaking 2020 Atlantic hurricane season, which exhausted the normal list of 21 storm names prepared by the organization.Greek letters had been used to name storms only once before, in 2005, another busy hurricane season that produced Hurricane Katrina, among others.National Weather Service officials said the Greek alphabet got in the way of the main reason for naming storms â€” to help the public readily identify and track them. Many people were confused by the sounds of the Greek letters, and public attention often focused more on the use of the alphabet itself than on the destruction caused by the storms, officials said.
