A Heavily Armed Man at a Grocery Store Adds to Anxiety in Atlanta
ATLANTA — Rico Marley walked into a grocery store in midtown Atlanta on Wednesday afternoon carrying a guitar bag.He headed for the men’s room, the authorities said, where he strapped on a bulletproof vest. He then donned a jacket, its pockets full of ammunition, and placed two loaded handguns in a left front pocket and two other loaded handguns in a right front pocket. In the guitar bag, he carried a 12-gauge shotgun, an AR-15 military-style rifle and a black ski mask.Then he walked out into the store.Police, tipped off by an alarmed shopper in the bathroom, soon stopped him. But the incident, just three miles from the site of one of the shootings last week that left eight people dead and coming two days after a man stormed a grocery store in Boulder, Colo., and killed 10, sent new waves of unease throughout greater Atlanta and also raised nationwide fears of copycat crimes.Though there has been no indication that Mr. Marley, 22, who was arrested at the store, was influenced by the two mass shootings, Jillian Peterson, an associate professor of criminal justice at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minn., said she feared a rise in similar attacks after nearly a year without such crimes in the U.S.
