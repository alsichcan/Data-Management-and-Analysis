Deb Haaland, interior secretary nominee, says she will enact ‘Biden’s agenda, not my own’ on fossil fuels.
Representative Deb Haaland of New Mexico, President Biden’s pick to head the Interior Department, sought Tuesday to find the line between her past remarks as an activist opposing the fossil fuel industry, and her prospective role at the helm of an agency that oversees drilling and conservation on the nation’s more than 500 million acres of public land.In the first day of a two-part confirmation hearing before the Senate Energy Committee, Ms. Haaland’s most important audience was the panel’s chairman, Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, a Democrat who has often sided with Republicans on environmental policy as he seeks to protect his home state’s coal industry.Privately, however, Democrats have warned Mr. Manchin against being seen as derailing the candidacy of Ms. Haaland, who, if confirmed, would make history as the first Native American cabinet secretary.Mr. Manchin asked Ms. Haaland if she supports the idea of American energy independence, to which she said, “We want to move forward with innovation,” but added, “That’s not going to happen overnight. We will still rely on fossil fuel energy.”
