How Sheldon Adelson’s Death Could Affect the G.O.P.’s Future
The death of Sheldon G. Adelson, the casino magnate who used his vast fortune to tip the balance of power in Washington over the last decade by helping Republicans take control of the House, the Senate and eventually the White House, adds another element of uncertainty for the party as it faces a bitter reckoning over President Trump’s legacy.Already, the fallout over the deadly siege on the Capitol by Trump supporters last week has hit the Republican Party financially, with several blue-chip corporations like Marriott and Blue Cross Blue Shield announcing that they would suspend donations to members of Congress who supported Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s victory.And while it seems likely that Mr. Adelson’s wife, Dr. Miriam Adelson, will continue with some of their family’s political giving, his passing Monday night at the age of 87 leaves Republicans without a benefactor whose donations were so crucial to the party’s success that only a small number of billionaires, like Charles Koch, rivaled his influence.
