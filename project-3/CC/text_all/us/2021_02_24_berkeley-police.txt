Berkeley Moves Closer to Ending Police Traffic Stops
Good morning.After Californians poured into the streets of cities across the state to protest police brutality and racism last summer, elected leaders pledged to implement reforms.Los Angeles’s mayor, Eric Garcetti, pledged to move $250 million from city departments — including a $150 million cut from the Police Department — to go toward communities of color. San Francisco’s mayor, London Breed, in June unveiled a four-point blueprint for dealing with racism and how the city’s Police Department addresses mental health and homelessness.But progress on those goals has been varied in the months since, not just within California, but across the country. And different jurisdictions have taken different approaches.Amid widespread calls to defund the police, for instance, school leaders in some cities have moved to reduce the presence of armed police officers in hallways. This month, the Los Angeles Unified School District voted to cut its police force and instead invest millions of the dollars it would have spent on armed security in programs for students of color and other measures, after student activists led a push to defund the department.
