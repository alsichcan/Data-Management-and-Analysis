Despite new C.D.C. mask guidance, the U.S. patchwork of mandates will take time to unravel.
As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention offered on Tuesday new guidance about when masks should be worn outdoors, people across the United States are living under an often confusing patchwork of limits, one that could continue for some time.Before the C.D.C.’s changes on Tuesday, 25 states had some form of statewide mask mandate, as did the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, according to a New York Times tracker of coronavirus restrictions across the country. In 24 other states there was no statewide mask mandate, while in Colorado masks could be required depending upon the number of cases diagnosed in a county.But even within a state, mask mandates can vary based upon county or city. Kansas has no statewide mask mandates, but a number of cities and counties have their own orders. In Colorado, masks must always be worn in specific indoor locations — like schools, hospitals and government buildings — but in some counties with a high rate of new cases, they must also be worn in all public indoor settings with 10 or more people.After the C.D.C.’s announcement on Tuesday, a handful of governors said they would relax their outdoor mask mandates. In Massachusetts, masks won’t be required unless it is not possible to social distance. Maine recommends wearing a mask outdoors when it’s difficult to stay distanced, and Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said on Tuesday that “if you’re fully vaccinated, outdoors and not in a large crowd — you do not need to wear a mask.”
