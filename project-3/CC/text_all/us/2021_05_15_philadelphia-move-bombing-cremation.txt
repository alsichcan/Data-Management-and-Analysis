Discovery of Bones From MOVE Bombing Jolts Philadelphia Once Again
The tortuous path of human remains from a deadly bombing that took place 36 years ago in Philadelphia took another jarring turn on Friday when city officials announced that bones they said had been cremated and discarded were apparently saved, after all, in a box in storage.The discovery of the remains came one day after city officials said Philadelphia’s health commissioner had resigned under pressure after acknowledging that he had authorized the cremation and disposal of the remains in 2017, without regard to the family’s wishes.Now officials want to know why the bones were not incinerated, after all. But they say the former commissioner, Thomas A. Farley, will not get his job back.“Nothing is changing relative to his employment,” said Deana Gamble, a spokeswoman for Jim Kenney, the mayor of Philadelphia. “He still made the wrong decision in 2017 that led to this unfortunate situation.”
