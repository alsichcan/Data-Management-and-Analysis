‘The Outside Story’ Review: Brooklyn as No One Has Ever Known It
The comedy “The Outside Story” takes a listless look at the life of Charles (Brian Tyree Henry), who is moping over his breakup with his unfaithful girlfriend, Isha (Sonequa Martin-Green). When Charles chases down a delivery person to offer a belated tip, he gets locked out of his Brooklyn apartment for a day and must set his self-pity aside.This predicament forces him into contact with the neighbors he never bothered getting to know. Unable to re-enter his comfort zone, he asks to use the bathroom of the polyamorous partners upstairs. He charges his phone with the help of the adolescent piano prodigy who lives in his building. Charles is depressed, but affably so. He’s amiable to everyone he meets, even the overachieving police officer (Sunita Mani), who finds a new reason to interrogate Charles each time she circles the block. With the help of his new friends, Charles reflects on his romantic relationship and contemplates reconciliation.
