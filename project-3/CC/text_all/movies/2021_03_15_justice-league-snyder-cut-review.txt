‘Zack Snyder’s Justice League’ Review: Supersized, Super Hopeless
No one knows hope like a fan: hope that your favorite writer won’t disappoint with the next chapter, hope that a character will triumph, hope that the heroes will save the day. Hope is baked into the pages of comic-book stories, which often subscribe to a belief that good and evil exist in a clear-cut binary, and that a light will always shine through, even in the darkest days.I know I’m leading you astray, beginning this review of Zack Snyder’s extended “Justice League” cut with hope when what follows will sound more like despair. And yet hope is at the core of this four-hour marathon of a film — and is also what it fails to understand.But let’s begin with the story, which you may already know from the 2017 theatrical release. (That version of the movie was taken over by the director Joss Whedon, and fans have been calling for Snyder’s original to be restored.) Superman (Henry Cavill) is dead, after the events of “Batman v Superman,” and an alien warrior named Steppenwolf (Ciarán Hinds) has traveled to Earth to collect three Mother Boxes, sources of endless destructive (and regenerative) energy that, when combined into a “Unity,” can destroy a whole world. Batman (Ben Affleck) recruits all the supers he can find — Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), Aquaman (Jason Momoa), the Flash (Ezra Miller), Cyborg (Ray Fisher) and, later, a resurrected Superman — to stop the impending apocalypse.
