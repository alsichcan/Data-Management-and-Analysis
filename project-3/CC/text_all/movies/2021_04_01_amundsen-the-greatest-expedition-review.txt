‘Amundsen: The Greatest Expedition’ Review: Ice, Ice, Baby
The subject of the sluggish Norwegian biopic “Amundsen: The Greatest Expedition” might be the polar explorer Roald Amundsen, but its star is frozen water. On clothing and facial hair, from North Pole to South, ice whitens the screen. There’s every indication Amundsen’s heart is carved from it, too.Clearly rejecting hagiography, the director, Espen Sandberg, presents Amundsen (Pal Sverre Hagen) as a cold, selfish fanatic with a cruel streak and a preference for married mistresses. Whenever we leave his frigid adventures to spend time with his estranged, rather tragic brother, Leon (a touching Christian Rubeck), it’s hard not to recognize him as the more humane, perhaps more admirable sibling.
