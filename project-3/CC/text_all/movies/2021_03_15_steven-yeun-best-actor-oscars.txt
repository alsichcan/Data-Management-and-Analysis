Steven Yeun Earns Best Actor Oscar Nomination for ‘Minari’
Steven Yeun tried to sleep through his history-making Oscar nomination. It was 5:45 a.m. in Los Angeles — really 4:45 a.m., given Daylight Saving Time — but his phone Would. Not. Stop.Bzz! Bzz! Bzz!“I tried really hard to go back to sleep,” said the 37-year-old actor, who scored a best actor nomination for his turn in Lee Isaac Chung’s “Minari,” about an immigrant trying to realize his dream of starting a farm in the heartland. “And I’m still tired. I apologize, I don’t even know what’s happening right now.”Yeun, who was born in South Korea and raised in the United States, was one of two men of Asian heritage nominated in the best actor category — along with Riz Ahmed (a Brit of Pakistani descent), who stars in “Sound of Metal” — at this year’s Academy Awards, the first time that’s happened in the 93-year history of the Oscars. It was also the first best actor nomination for a man of Asian heritage in nearly 20 years.
