‘Savage State’ Review: Escape to New York
“Savage State,” the sophomore feature from the French writer and director David Perrault, is a fascinating oddity: An unconventional western dominated by the desires of women.Set mainly in 1863, the story follows a family of wealthy French settlers forced to flee their home in Missouri when the youngest daughter, Esther (Alice Isaaz), angers a Union soldier. The American Civil War, though, is only a distant background to their arduous trek across the country to New York, where they plan to board a ship to France. Accompanied by their mercenary guide, Victor (Kevin Janssens), the family is soon frayed by internal problems and external dangers. Not the least of these is Victor’s nemesis, an implacable female bandit (Kate Moran) with a score to settle and a romantic obsession to satisfy.
