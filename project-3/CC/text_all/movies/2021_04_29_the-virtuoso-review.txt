‘The Virtuoso’ Review: A Paid Killer, Hitting Bum Notes
The existential anxiety of the paid assassin is a tricky theme — so tricky as to be potentially invalid, even. “The Virtuoso,” directed by Nick Stagliano from a script by James C. Wolf, misses its shot in a spectacular, and sometimes spectacularly pretentious, fashion.The very square-jawed Anson Mount plays the title character. In the opening scene, he shoots a woman, straight through the sternum it looks like, while she’s naked and straddling a man backwards. She has the presence of mind to climb off her partner so Mount’s “virtuoso” can plug that man through the forehead.
