‘Stowaway’ Review: An Outer-Space Drama, Lacking Gravity
Films set in outer space are often on a quest for meaning, filling the vast unknown of the galaxy with humanity’s basest anxieties. “Stowaway,” directed by Joe Penna, pushes a crew of space explorers to moral and physical extremes when an unexpected passenger accidentally compromises their oxygen supply. Yet for all the empathy it expects of its viewers — every character cries onscreen at least once — the film is troublingly removed from human reality.That’s not to say these characters aren’t likable or well-rendered by the starry cast. Toni Collette stands out as always, playing a veteran astronaut on her last mission. Anna Kendrick does well as the beating heart of this film, a foil to the stoic Daniel Dae Kim. And Shamier Anderson holds his own as the surprise fourth crew member, though he is given far too little to work with.
