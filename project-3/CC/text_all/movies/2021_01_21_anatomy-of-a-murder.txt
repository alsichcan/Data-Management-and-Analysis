Looking for a Great Courtroom Drama? Start Here
Gateway Movies offers ways to begin exploring directors, genres and topics in film by examining a few streaming movies.Ready-made pressure-cookers that force audiences to question their own values, American courtroom movies are practically a genre of their own. Yet even the greatest ones give in to some pretty hokey dramatic impulses. Think of Jack Nicholson’s huffing, “You can’t handle the truth!” at the end of “A Few Good Men.” Paul Newman’s closing argument to the jury in “The Verdict” mentions faith, power and the symbols of justice — and not a single fact from the case.Otto Preminger’s “Anatomy of a Murder” (1959), one of the greatest trial movies, isn’t immune to that sort of grandstanding, but here the witness whose last-minute testimony wraps up the proceedings doesn’t neatly settle matters of guilt or innocence. By convention, courtroom films tend to tilt viewers’ sympathy toward an underdog or the wrongfully accused. But in “Anatomy of a Murder,” the defendant has indisputably committed the killing he’s accused of, and his defense lawyer is played by Jimmy Stewart — no one’s idea of an underdog, at least by the late ’50s. (He may have played one in “Mr. Smith Goes to Washington” in 1939, but was now well into the darker, postwar phase of his career.)
