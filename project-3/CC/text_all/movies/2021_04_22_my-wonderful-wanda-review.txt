‘My Wonderful Wanda’ Review: The Secret Life of a Caretaker
Though this film is set against a beautiful and placid Swiss lake, the happenings inside the wealthy Wegmeister-Gloor residence reveal a tangled web of relations that unravels into the droll drama, “My Wonderful Wanda.” Wanda (Agnieszka Grochowska) is a Polish caretaker who looks after the house’s aging patriarch, Josef (André Jung). She bathes and changes him, but at night, she sleeps with him for extra cash that she saves for the two sons waiting for her in Poland. Her stony face never betrays any sign of pleasure, but Josef is clearly satisfied; by the second act, Wanda is pregnant with his child.
