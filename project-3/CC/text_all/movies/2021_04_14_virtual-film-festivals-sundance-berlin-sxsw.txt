Red Carpet or Not, Film Festivals Roll On
It was January 2020, several weeks before everything jerked to a halt. Film fans were wondering if Bong Joon Ho’s “Parasite” could go the distance at the upcoming Oscars. In Lincoln Center’s quiet Furman Gallery, across the lobby from the Walter Reade Theater, Eugene Hernandez assembled the staff of the New York Film Festival, the annual fall showcase to which he’d just been appointed director. Whiteboards went up on the wall. Notepads and laptops came out.“I wanted the New York Film Festival to be New York’s film festival,” Hernandez recalled, stressing a widening perspective beyond the Upper West Side. “I kept repeating that to anyone who would ask.” Already he had a vision of exporting the festival to other boroughs via outdoor screenings that would be masterminded by Hernandez’s longtime friend, Dan Nuxoll, the president of the organization Rooftop Films.Little did they know how important that decision would be when the pandemic knocked indoor screenings out of the equation. “One of the first calls I made after we decided to go forward,” Hernandez said, “was to say to Dan, ‘OK, remember that meeting we had, when we wanted Rooftop to add some ancillary events? Now Rooftop is the festival.’”
