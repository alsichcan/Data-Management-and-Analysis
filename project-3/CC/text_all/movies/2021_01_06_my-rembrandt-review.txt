‘My Rembrandt’ Review: Seeing a Dutch Master Everywhere
For the documentary “My Rembrandt,” the director Oeke Hoogendijk assembles an assortment of Rembrandt owners and experts whose interests in the Dutch master have, for different reasons, taken on faintly obsessive dimensions.The Duke of Buccleuch in Scotland speaks of the subject of “Old Woman Reading” (1655) as if she were alive (“she is the most powerful presence in this house”) and strives to find the ideal viewing angle and lighting for the painting in a new room. The billionaire investor Thomas S. Kaplan, who has to pause when tallying how many Rembrandts he owns, recalls kissing one as soon as he had the legal right to do so.
