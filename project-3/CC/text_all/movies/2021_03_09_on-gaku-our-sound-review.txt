‘On-Gaku: Our Sound’ Review: They Will Rock You
Rock ’n’ roll is here to stay, and so is “On-Gaku: Our Sound,” a quirky homage to classic animation and 1960s-70s rock with an idiosyncratic style and the thrumming heart of a musician.In the film, directed by Kenji Iwaisawa, three high school friends with nothing better to do than play video games and ambivalently pick fights with a rival gang impulsively decide to start a band. The friends end up performing in a local music festival — despite their utter lack of musical knowledge. Narratively that’s the extent of it, but “On-Gaku” is a subdued filmmaking experiment, with the visuals and sounds of the movie positioned in the forefront of our attention. No worries, just good vibes.
