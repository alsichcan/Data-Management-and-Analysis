‘The Mitchells vs. the Machines’ Review: When Bots Attack
Nothing says “family bonding” like a road trip through a robot apocalypse. At least that’s the case for the Mitchells in the quirky and riotously funny Netflix animated film “The Mitchells vs. the Machines.”Katie Mitchell (Abbi Jacobson), a movie buff with a lengthy filmography of YouTube videos, is heading off to college to find “her people”: fellow tech-savvy, meme-loving cinephiles. She clashes with her nature-obsessed father, Rick (Danny McBride), who pitches Katie a last-minute family road-trip to her school along with Linda (Maya Rudolph), Katie’s aggressively positive mother; Aaron (Mike Rianda), Katie’s dinosaur-obsessed little brother; and Monchi, their chunky walleyed pug.
