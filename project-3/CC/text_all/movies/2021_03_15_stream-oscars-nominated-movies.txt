Where to Stream ‘Nomadland,’ ‘Minari’ and More 2021 Oscar Nominees
The nominees for the 93rd Academy Awards were announced this morning and the vast majority of them are available to watch right away in the United States, because of a combination of the pandemic prompting a shift toward home viewing, an abundance of streaming exclusives and the decision to delay the ceremony until late April. There are two prominent exceptions, however: “Judas and the Black Messiah,” a nominee for six awards, including best picture, premiered on HBO Max and theaters on the same day, but its streaming window expired Sunday night.

Here’s a complete rundown of where to find all the major awards hopefuls.
