‘Truth or Consequences’ Review: Ghost Town at the End of the World
You don’t need to be told that the town of Truth or Consequences, N.M., has an evocative name. And indeed, it’s been used as a title before, albeit for an entirely inconsequential film. This disquieting movie, called a “speculative documentary” by its director, Hannah Jayanti, has more weight.Jayanti’s camera takes in the plain, sun-drenched streets, mountains in the background; the place looks like a ghost town. Prowling through a labyrinth of broken, castaway electronics and other such junk, Jayanti places a virtual-reality filter over the imagery that adds an eerier quality to already unusual sights. Eventually she shows the viewer a sort of retro-futuristic structure called Spaceport America.
