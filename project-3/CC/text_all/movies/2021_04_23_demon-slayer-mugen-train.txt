What to Know Before Watching ‘Demon Slayer: Mugen Train’
While Americans hunkered down at home for the last year, theatergoers in other countries were buzzing on social media about an anime movie, “Demon Slayer: Mugen Train.”The film, which follows a teenage boy seeking revenge against demons that killed his family, has been one of the most successful movies to ever come out of Japan. After shattering box office records when it debuted there last October, “Demon Slayer” has earned more than $400 million in ticket sales, surpassing Hayao Miyazaki’s masterpiece “Spirited Away” to become Japan’s highest grossing anime film of all time. On Twitter, fans gushed about it, and, remarkably in a pandemic, many said they would return to the theaters for repeat viewings.After much delay, “Demon Slayer” will finally make a splashy debut in the United States on Friday in 1,500 theaters, including some Imax screens. But unlike “Spirited Away” and typical box office hits, this film doesn’t stand on its own. If you walk into it blind — without viewing, say, the “Demon Slayer” TV show — you may find yourself confused.
