‘Supernova’ Review: On the Road, to a Heartbreaking Destination
It’s rare to see a cinematic drama executed with such consistent care as “Supernova,” written and directed by Harry Macqueen and starring Colin Firth and Stanley Tucci. And here, that care pays off to devastating effect.Firth and Tucci play Sam and Tusker, a longtime couple who, we learn early on, derive as much pleasure from snarky bickering as they do from sex, snuggling and serious conversation. As they toddle through England’s lake country in an R.V., Macqueen unravels their back story subtly and organically. Sam was once a concert pianist; Tusker is a novelist and an astronomy enthusiast. On a break from driving, Sam pages through one of Tusker’s works and waxes sarcastic about the novel’s challenging style.Tusker’s current challenge is early-onset dementia. He’s insistent on working through it. Up to a point.
