‘The Djinn’ Review: A Boy Whose Wish Comes True
In the supernatural horror movie “The Djinn,” a dramatic, somewhat corny fairy-talelike voice recites the contents of a mysterious book of spells to the audience. When the 12-year-old Dylan (Ezra Dewey) discovers this book, which lays out instructions for making wishes, he needs no time to settle on one great desire. He craves something he does not have: the ability to speak. That night, when he is left home alone, Dylan gets his wish.The “be careful what you wish for” trope is so common in horror films that it’s hardly a spoiler to say that his wish comes with dire consequences. He conjures the evil djinn, or genie, setting in motion a night of terror. The fable facade is a deceptive precursor for a film that’s definitely not for kids.
