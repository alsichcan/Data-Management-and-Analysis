Sundance Diary, Part 5: A Final List of Movies to Revisit
A.O. Scott, our co-chief film critic, is keeping a diary as he “attends” the virtual Sundance Film Festival, which ends Wednesday. Read previous entries here and here.Tuesday, 11 a.m.: For better and sometimes for worse, the Sundance Film Festival has been part of the continuity of American movies for decades: a proving ground for young careers; a marketplace for the trendy and the genuinely new; a zone where commercial aspiration intersects with artistic ambition and social concern. It’s encouraging — maybe even astonishing — that in 2021 it still managed to be all of those things.Keeping its traditional spot on the calendar, at a time when every schedule has gone haywire, was no small accomplishment. The festival was a little shorter this year, with fewer movies, but it still felt packed and a little frantic. It was easier than ever to skip the parties and the Q. and A. sessions, and there was something charming about the filmmaker introductions that preceded each screening. A programmer in front of a bookcase or a houseplant welcoming a filmmaker with a slightly different version of the same backdrop.Did I appreciate the movies more because I watched them at home? Maybe, in the sense that I was especially grateful for their power to transport me beyond the tedium of everyday pandemic life. Some of the most satisfying journeys were into the past. I don’t know if that’s because the present era of cascading crises makes me seek out the stability and reassurance of historical knowledge, or if it’s more that I’m driven to search the past for clues. Or maybe this was just a strong year for history-minded documentaries, an often convention-bound mode of filmmaking that seems to be in the midst of a creative reawakening.
