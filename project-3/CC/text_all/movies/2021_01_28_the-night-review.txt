‘The Night’ Review: Late Checkout
“The Night” begins with a round of the party game, Mafia. The film’s central couple Babak (Shahab Hosseini) and Neda (Niousha Jafarian) play along, each wryly accusing the other of hiding secrets, each saying that the other might be the killer. The Persian-language, Los Angeles-set thriller that follows builds tension around the resentments that have accumulated in their marriage. But the stakes never rise past the movie’s first game.With their infant daughter in tow, Babak and Neda head home from a night of friends, drinks and Mafia. But Babak’s driving is impaired from the libations, so the family stops to stay overnight at a nearby hotel. There, the evening begins its descent from confusion to horror. The couple begins to encounter strange figures — a babbling drifter on the hotel steps, an ominous desk clerk, a woman who wanders in silence, a child who calls for his mother.
