2021 Oscars Nominations: Snubs and Surprises for Daniel Kaluuya, Lakeith Stanfield and Jodie Foster
Plenty of history was made when the Academy Award nominations were announced Monday morning, but it just wouldn’t be the Oscars without a few swerves and head-scratching omissions. Below, the Projectionist surveys the biggest surprises and most high-profile snubs.When two men or two women colead an Oscar contender, you can bet that savvy strategists will position one as a lead and one as a supporting role in a bid to spread the wealth and get them both nominated. That was the original plan for “Judas and the Black Messiah,” where Lakeith Stanfield was deemed the lead, mostly so he could get out of the way of Daniel Kaluuya, who’s been racking up supporting-actor wins all seasons. But in a big surprise, Stanfield picked up more votes in the supporting-actor category, so both men earned their nominations there. It does raise the question, though: If Stanfield and Kaluuya are both supporting actors, then who exactly is this movie supposed to be about?Though “The Trial of the Chicago 7” is one of the most nominated Oscar contenders and Aaron Sorkin picked up a nomination for his screenplay, he was left out of the best-director lineup entirely as “Another Round” director Thomas Vinterberg nabbed the spot most expected would go to Sorkin. Still, plenty of history was made in that category: The “Nomadland” director Chloé Zhao became the first Chinese woman and first woman of color to be nominated for best director, and alongside “Promising Young Woman” filmmaker Emerald Fennell, this is the first time in Oscar history that two women were nominated in the best-director category at the same time.
