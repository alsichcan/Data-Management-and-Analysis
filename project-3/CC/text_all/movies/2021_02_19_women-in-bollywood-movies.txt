As Bollywood Evolves, Women Find Deeper Roles
“Women are born to make sacrifices for men.”This dialogue comes from the 1995 Bollywood film “Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,” where the main character, Simran, has fallen in love but her family has already arranged for her to marry someone else. Her mother asks her to sacrifice that love in deference to her father’s wishes.For Bollywood, the world’s largest film industry, the road to an authentic portrayal of women has been bumpy. In India’s Hindi film realm, onscreen mothers have long been depicted as passive housewives who bow to patriarchal pressures.But this portrayal is being challenged. A number of movies in recent years have shown mothers, and women overall, as full and complex human beings — not melodramatic side characters, but outspoken, independent leads who are in charge of their own fates.“Tribhanga,” which was released on Netflix in January, is one such film. The story follows Anuradha (Kajol), an actress and dancer, who must face the demons of her past when her estranged mother, Nayantara (Tanvi Azmi), ends up in the hospital. Nayantara, who is a highly accomplished writer, gets to tell her side of the story in flashbacks, through conversations with a disciple who is recording material for a biography.
