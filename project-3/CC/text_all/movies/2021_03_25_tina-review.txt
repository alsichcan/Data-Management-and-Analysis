‘Tina’ Review: A Music Icon Looks Back With Grace
In 2009, Tina Turner gave her final public performance. After which she did something that only a few mega-famous musicians actually succeed at: she retired. With her second husband, the former record company executive Erwin Bach, she took up a life far from both the country of her birth and the bustle of the music industry, in Zurich.But Turner continues to inspire. In 2019 a Broadway musical based on her life, made with her cooperation, became a hit. Her songs, both in partnership with Ike Turner and solo, are staples of classic radio stations. For this documentary, directed by Dan Lindsay and T.J. Martin, she sat down for a stocktaking interview; this film is not just a summing up but a kind of farewell.
