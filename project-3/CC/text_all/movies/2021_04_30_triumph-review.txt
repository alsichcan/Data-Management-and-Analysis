‘Triumph’ Review: Going to the Mat
“Triumph” tells the story of Mike (RJ Mitte), a high school senior in the 1980s who aspires to join the wrestling team. Because he has cerebral palsy, even adults who admire his resolve — like Coach Warren (Terrence Howard), who teaches Mike in a phys-ed class, and Mike’s single father (Johnathon Schaech) — don’t initially believe he can do it. Directed by Brett Leonard, the film was inspired by the experiences of its screenwriter, Michael D. Coffey.
