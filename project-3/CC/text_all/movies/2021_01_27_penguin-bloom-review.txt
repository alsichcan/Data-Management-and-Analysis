‘Penguin Bloom’ Review: Relearning to Fly
Anyone paying a smidge of attention to the early scenes of “Penguin Bloom” should be able to write the ending — and most of what precedes it — long before it arrives. Yet predictability isn’t the only problem with this based-on-true-life drama, one that underscores every sentiment and tugs every heartstring with wincing insistence.When a 2013 accident in Thailand leaves Sam Bloom (Naomi Watts) unable to walk, her husband, Cameron (Andrew Lincoln), and three young sons struggle to dislodge her depression. The family’s idyllic beachfront home in Sydney, Australia, only reminds Sam of her love of surfing and the limitations of her wheelchair. Even her little woolen hats droop despondently. Then the children bring home an injured magpie chick, name it Penguin, and turn it loose to work its feathery magic.
