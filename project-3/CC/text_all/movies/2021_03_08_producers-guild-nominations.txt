Producers Guild Nominations Boost ‘Chicago 7’ and ‘Nomadland’
Over the last two years, every film nominated for best picture at the Oscars was first nominated by the influential Producers Guild of America. Few awards-season precursors can offer so ironclad a guarantee.Expect, then, that this year’s PGA Award nominees, which were announced Monday, will separate most of the would-be contenders from the films that will actually go the distance.Here is the list of nominees:“Borat Subsequent Moviefilm”“Judas and the Black Messiah”“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”“Mank”“Minari”“Nomadland”“One Night in Miami”“Promising Young Woman”“Sound of Metal”“The Trial of the Chicago 7”The PGA lineup brought expected good news for films like “Nomadland,” “The Trial of the Chicago 7” and “Mank,” which have performed strongly in most of the ceremonies so far this season. Other well-positioned contenders like “Promising Young Woman,” “Minari,” “One Night in Miami” and “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” also landed on the list, and should make the final cut of nominees when the Oscar nominations are announced on March 15.
