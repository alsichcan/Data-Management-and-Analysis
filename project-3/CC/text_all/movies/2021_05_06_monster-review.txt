‘Monster’ Review: Teenager on Trial
Kelvin Harrison Jr. has portrayed his share of promising young men at risk, using his wholesome good looks and charismatic glow as a canvas for ambiguity. In “Monster,” which first premiered at Sundance in 2018, Harrison plays Steve, a New York honors student accused of playing lookout for a deadly bodega stickup.Anthony Mandler, a music video director making his feature debut, switches between Steve’s lives before and after the violent event. One moment the budding young filmmaker is shooting street scenes with friends or a local dealer (ASAP Rocky) who takes an interest; the next, he’s in jail and on trial, viewed as another anonymous Black defendant.
