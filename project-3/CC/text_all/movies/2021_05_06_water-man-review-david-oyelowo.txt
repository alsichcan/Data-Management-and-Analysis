‘The Water Man’ Review: Oyelowo Directs With a Touch of Magic
The keen affinity the actor David Oyelowo has for his fellow performers is the best thing about “The Water Man,” his feature directorial debut. Scripted by Emily A. Needell, the picture is a family drama with a supernatural angle, centered on illness.Lonnie Chavis plays Gunner, a sensitive and creative tween who works on his graphic novel (the inked frames become animated and speak to him as he draws) while his parents deal with life in a rural town. (The movie was shot in Oregon.) As the father, Oyelowo is a little dim about his son’s real passions — he accidentally overturns a bottle of Gunner’s ink when asking him to come outside to “toss the ball around.”
