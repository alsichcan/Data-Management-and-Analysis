‘Riders of Justice’ Review: Just Give Me a Reason
In the jarring opening scene of “Riders of Justice,” one girl’s bike is stolen and turned into another kid’s Christmas present, kicking off a chain of events that results in a disastrous subway explosion. When Otto (Nikolaj Lie Kaas), a probability expert suffering from a bad case of survivor’s guilt, pins the calamity on the leader of a criminal gang, he inadvertently triggers another round of violence.The Danish filmmaker Anders Thomas Jensen understands that the most difficult tragedies to process are the inexplicable ones, the kind where there’s no one to blame. This idea is at the core of his gold-hearted, yet gleefully bloody deconstruction of the revenge thriller and the meat-headed masculine urges that typically underscore the genre.
