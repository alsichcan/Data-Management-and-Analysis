‘Kid 90’ Review: Celluloid Dreams
At the heart of Soleil Moon Frye’s new film, “Kid 90” (streaming on Hulu), is a startling drive for self-documentation. Beginning in her early teens, Moon Frye, who starred on the popular children’s show “Punky Brewster,” began recording her life with a video camera. She seems to have taken her camcorder everywhere: film sets, road trips, parties with fellow child stars, even her breast reduction surgery at age 15. When she didn’t film something, she recorded her reflections on audiotape or in her journal with precocious introspectiveness.
