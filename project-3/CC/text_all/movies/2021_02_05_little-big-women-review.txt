‘Little Big Women’ Review: Heartbreak is a Family Affair
In the Taiwanese melodrama “Little Big Women,” a matriarch and her three adult daughters grieve a complicated loss. Early in the film, the sisters learn that their father, long absent from their lives, has passed away. Embracing sentimentality in every scene, this occasionally endearing and often cloying film examines what it means to mourn someone who was already gone.Streaming on Netflix after a successful box office run in Taiwan, the film follows Lin Shoying (Chen Shu-fang), a restaurant owner whose family confronts a number of crises over the course of this slow-moving story. But her biggest heartbreak comes in the opening minutes, when her 70th birthday is interrupted by the death of her estranged husband. As Shoying grudgingly arranges his funeral, she privately vows to track down his most recent romantic partner.
