‘Two of Us’ Review: Thwarted Love
Nina (the distinguished German actress Barbara Sukowa) and Madeleine (Martine Chevallier) have waited decades to love one another freely. At the beginning of “Two of Us,” the retired women — their romance long hidden under the guise of friendship — prepare to leave France for new beginnings in Rome. Timid, dutiful Madeleine, a widowed mother whose nickname is “Mado,” must first come out to her children before realizing her dream, but tragedy strikes before she can speak her truth. A stroke leaves Mado speechless and paralyzed, throwing the couple even deeper into the closet during already devastating times.Filippo Meneghetti’s pulsing romantic drama forges heartache and intrigue out of Nina’s tireless efforts to connect with her impaired lover. Played with palpable desperation and ferocity by Sukowa (“Hannah Arendt,” “Lola”), Nina is relegated to the status of friendly neighbor by Mado’s unsuspecting children. Yet she craftily maneuvers her way into Mado’s life with a tenacity that never overshadows her pain.
