Dominique Fishback Gave Her Heart to ‘Judas and the Black Messiah’
You might not be expecting romance from “Judas and the Black Messiah,” since it’s being sold as the tragic clash of two men: Fred Hampton (Daniel Kaluuya), the young and charismatic chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party, and Bill O’Neal (Lakeith Stanfield), the F.B.I. informant whose betrayal of Hampton would result in the leader’s killing by the authorities.Still, it’s Hampton’s shy, deepening connection to the activist Deborah Johnson — who now goes by Akua Njeri — that gives the movie its heart and soul. Credit Dominique Fishback for that: The 29-year-old actress, who appeared in the HBO mini-series “Show Me a Hero” as well as the Netflix movie “Project Power,” is tender and moving as Johnson, delivering a breakout performance that proves she can more than hold her own in a cast of high-profile heavyweights.To Fishback, the project is a perfect fit. “I’ve been manifesting a romance role for a really long time,” she said, “but I also get to honor the legacy of Chairman Fred and the Black Panther Party.” The movie also drew upon her skills as a writer and poet: In one pivotal scene, a pregnant Johnson recites a poem to Hampton that Fishback wrote herself.In a conversation over video chat last week, Fishback eagerly cited some of the swoon-worthy pop-culture romances she grew up on, like those in “New Girl,” “The Notebook” and “Gossip Girl.” But when it came to the connection between Hampton and Johnson, Fishback made sure to keep it real: “Just because they’re revolutionaries and powerful people onstage doesn’t mean that in their private lives, when it comes to falling in love, they’re going to know everything.”
