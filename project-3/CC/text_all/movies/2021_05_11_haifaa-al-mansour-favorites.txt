Haifaa Al-Mansour Rocks Out to Punk and Cooks With TikTok
When Haifaa Al-Mansour was a child, movie theaters were illegal. But the small Saudi Arabian town where she lived with her parents and siblings had a Blockbuster outlet. Her father, a poet, rented movies there often, “mostly to keep his 12 kids busy and out of his hair,” Al-Mansour said. She spent her childhood watching Hollywood hits, Bollywood musicals and Chinese martial arts flicks.In 2012, Al-Mansour became the country’s first female feature-length filmmaker, with “Wadjda,” a gentle neorealist movie about a girl determined to buy a bicycle. She directed it while hidden in the back of a van, as working with men — or even driving herself to set — was prohibited at that time.“I don’t know if I would be a filmmaker if I had grown up in the United States,” she said. “I imagine I would have had a very successful career, but maybe I wouldn’t have felt the need to have a voice.”After some time in Hollywood — “Nappily Ever After,” “Mary Shelley” — she returned to Saudi Arabia to make “The Perfect Candidate,” a quiet drama about a Saudi doctor, Maryam (Mila Al Zahrani), who runs for office in a local election while her father, a musician, travels with the national band. This time, she could direct out in the open.
