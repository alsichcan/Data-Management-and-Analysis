‘Promising Young Woman’ Director Emerald Fennell on Her Historic Oscar Nomination
“Promising Young Woman” has been a major player this awards season, and writer-director Emerald Fennell had every reason to expect that Monday’s Oscar nominations would bring even more good news for her first feature.She just didn’t want to do herself in by dwelling on it.“Last night, I think I did what any sensible person would do: I watched about six hours of ‘Married at First Sight Australia’ to take my mind off it,” Fennell said. “Especially when you’re making an independent film, you can’t ever hope for something like this.”And after all that anticipation, Fennell almost missed the announcement entirely: The British filmmaker had planned to watch the nominations live, but she hadn’t factored in the hour lost to daylight saving. As her nomination for best original screenplay was read, an oblivious Fennell was still on a work call fielded from her office in the English countryside.
