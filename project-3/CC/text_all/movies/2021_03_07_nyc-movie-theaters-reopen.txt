‘Welcome Back!’: Movie Theaters Reopen in New York City
Around 9:45 a.m. on Friday morning, the creaky metal awning, that for almost a year had walled off moviegoers from the Angelika Film Center on Houston Street, rolled up with a lurch. There was the gleaming glass box office with a smiling attendant. Behind him sprawled the theater, its retro light bulbs aglow again.Marilyn Evans, 73, who said she lived nearby, climbed the short flight of stairs and paused before walking inside.“At last!” she exclaimed. “I have five tickets over the next four days. That’s how much I’ve missed this.”
