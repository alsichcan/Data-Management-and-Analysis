The Snyder Cut: What’s New, What’s Gone (and More About That Ending)
“Zack Snyder’s Justice League,” out now on HBO Max, bears very little resemblance to the version of “Justice League” released by Warner Bros. in 2017.It’s well known at this point that the theatrical version was released after much behind-the-scenes drama: Zack Snyder found himself fighting over the creative direction of the movie with the studio, which was anxious for an “Avengers”-style hit that would be the beginning of a billion-dollar franchise. Fed up and grieving the recent loss of his daughter, Snyder walked away during postproduction; Joss Whedon, who’d already been brought in to add touches of humor to the screenplay, finished the job. Although the resulting movie earned more than $650 million worldwide, it was lambasted by critics and disappointed fans. Their vocal campaign to #ReleaseTheSnyderCut persuaded HBO Max, an arm of WarnerMedia, to let Snyder do just that.It took him four years, $70 million, and hundreds of hours of shooting and editing to finally realize his vision. This isn’t simply a director’s cut. It’s an altogether different movie.Free of cringe-inducing gags about podcasts and alien probes, the movie feels liberated from a certain brand of popular mainstream filmmaking and more like the work of one artist: Snyder, who clearly takes this superhero stuff very seriously. It emphasizes big emotion and earnest, heart-on-sleeve displays of masculine feeling.
