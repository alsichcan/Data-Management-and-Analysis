‘Judas and the Black Messiah’ Review: I Was a Panther for the F.B.I.
“I was in the struggle.” That’s Bill O’Neal’s summary of his participation in the radical Black politics of the late-1960s, delivered a bit defensively and with emphatic disdain for those who stayed on the sidelines. It’s an odd way to describe the dual role he played, as head of security for the Black Panther Party in Chicago and as a paid informant for the F.B.I. If he was in the struggle, there must also have been quite a struggle in him.O’Neal, played by Lakeith Stanfield and glimpsed briefly in documentary footage, is one of the title characters in “Judas and the Black Messiah,” Shaka King’s tense, methodical historical drama. O’Neal’s counterpart — the target of his betrayal and of the government’s lethal hostility — is Fred Hampton, chairman of the Illinois Panthers.The phrase “Black messiah” doesn’t reflect romantic revolutionary hyperbole, but rather the paranoia of J. Edgar Hoover (Martin Sheen), who saw African-American militants as the gravest internal threat to national security and feared the emergence of a popular, crowd-inspiring national leader. As Hampton, Daniel Kaluuya takes up the burden of incarnating and exorcising both the monster of Hoover’s imagination and a martyr of the Black Power movement. He more than meets the challenge of uncovering the striving, doubting, thinking person underneath those myths.
