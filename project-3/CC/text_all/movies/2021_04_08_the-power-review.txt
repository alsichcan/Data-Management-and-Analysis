‘The Power’ Review: Night Terrors During a London Blackout
In 1970s Britain, as the government and trade unions were warring, blackouts were regularly ordered to conserve power. During one of these pitch-black nights, a timid young woman named Val (Rose Williams) finds herself working the dark shift on her first day of duty as a trainee nurse at a run-down London hospital. The writer and director Corinna Faith doesn’t wait for the lights to dim to unleash the uneasiness in “The Power.” The creaky, eerie atmosphere is felt even in daylight as Val starts to hear children’s indecipherable whispers. “A place people die in should never be allowed to get that dark,” one nurse says, anxiously building up the frights to come, which work to a mixed degree.
