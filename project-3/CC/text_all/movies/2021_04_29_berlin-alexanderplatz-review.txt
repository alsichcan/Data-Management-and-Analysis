‘Berlin Alexanderplatz’ Review: Reframing an Urban Classic
Alfred Döblin’s masterpiece “Berlin Alexanderplatz” received its most famous dramatization not at the movies but on TV, with Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s 15-hour adaptation in 1980. Burhan Qurbani’s ambitious film by the same name re-centers the Weimar Era original on a 21st-century immigrant from Guinea-Bissau who seeks the straight and narrow but works for a psychopathic drug dealer.Cash is one reason that Franz (a quietly winning Welket Bungué) stays in the orbit of Reinhold (Albrecht Schuch), a sniveling underboss who promises newcomers to Berlin a way out of poverty and discrimination. But Franz’s loyalty is rewarded with Reinhold’s sadistic betrayals, which leave Franz near dead and missing half an arm. Reinhold exerts a Svengali-like hold on Franz and the women they know, though the character’s questionable magnetism makes this dynamic increasingly baffling.
