Zendaya on ‘Malcolm & Marie’ and That Toxic Relationship
When Zendaya began production of “Malcolm & Marie,” the made-during-lockdown Netflix drama she stars in with John David Washington, she never imagined that it would spark both strong criticism and award-season buzz.The widespread interest shouldn’t have been such a surprise: last year the 24-year-old became the youngest winner of the Emmy for best actress for her gripping performance as Rue, a struggling teen addict in HBO’s drama series “Euphoria.” She’s now up for a Critics Choice Award for Malcolm & Marie.After production of Season 2 of “Euphoria” was suspended because of the pandemic, Zendaya and the show’s creator, Sam Levinson, wanted to see if they could create a film during quarantine last year. The result was “Malcolm & Marie,” shot at a home in Northern California doubling for Malibu, by a 22-member cast and crew (most of whom worked on “Euphoria”), in just two weeks.“You know, it’s funny, if you would have told us that there would be a conversation around, you know, awards or whatever, that’s crazy! We were all just figuring it out together,” Zendaya said.
