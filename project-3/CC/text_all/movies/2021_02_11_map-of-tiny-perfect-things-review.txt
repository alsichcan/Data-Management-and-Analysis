‘The Map of Tiny Perfect Things’ Review: Another Do-Over
Last year, “Palm Springs” proved that the time-loop conceit from “Groundhog Day” still had some laughs in it. “The Map of Tiny Perfect Things” shows it’s a perfectly fine pretext for teenage treacle.Adapted by Lev Grossman from his 2016 short story, the movie begins with its timeline already on repeat. Mark (Kyle Allen), a 17-year-old aspiring art student, has found that foreknowledge hasn’t gotten him any closer to a date. Then one day — or, technically, that day — he spots Margaret (Kathryn Newton), clearly out of place at the public pool he knows well. She’s stuck in the same loop. And better to loop together than loop alone.
