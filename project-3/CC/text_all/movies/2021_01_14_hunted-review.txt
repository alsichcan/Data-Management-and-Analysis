‘Hunted’ Review: Catch Me if You Can
Adding a fairy-tale cast to a generic horror setup is of no benefit to “Hunted,” Vincent Paronnaud’s unpleasant merger of slasher movie and survival thriller.Claiming kinship with the fable of Little Red Riding Hood, the story introduces Eve (Lucie Debay), who will serve as both victim and heroine. Recently arrived in an unfamiliar town to manage a construction project, Eve — rather obviously sporting a crimson, hooded jacket — ducks her demanding boss and heads to a bar. When a skeevy, stubbled stranger (Arieh Worthalter) guides her from dance floor to waiting car, her reckless acquiescence to his wolfish charm is baffling. Until we factor in her bellyful of mojitos.
