‘Minari’ Review: Sinking Korean Roots in the Arkansas Soil
Minari is a leafy green vegetable (sometimes called water celery or water dropwort) popular in Korean cooking. In Lee Isaac Chung’s lovely new film, it flourishes in an Arkansas creek bed, supplying a title, a precise bit of detail, and maybe also a metaphor.Like the minari, Jacob and Monica Yi and their two children, Anne (Noel Kate Cho) and David (Alan Kim), are transplants. In the 1980s, reversing the path of an earlier, Dust Bowl migration, the family, originally from South Korea, has left California to take up farming near the Ozarks. The parents (Steven Yeun and Yeri Han) work as chicken sexers in a local poultry processing plant, but Jacob has entrepreneurial ambitions. Every year, he explains to his wife, 30,000 Koreans arrive in the United States, and he wants to grow the kind of produce that will give them a taste of home.“Minari” is partly the story of his struggle to get the business off the ground. The film’s moods and rhythms — the gentle intensity of the scenes, the way the plot emerges from hard work, careful attention and the mysterious operations of the natural world — feel rooted in agrarian life.
