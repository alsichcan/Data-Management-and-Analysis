What Do Lars Ulrich and A.O. Scott Have in Common? A Lot, It Turns Out
In December, Rolling Stone asked Lars Ulrich, the Metallica drummer, which celebrity he’d most want to quarantine with. His surprising answer was The New York Times’s co-chief film critic A.O. Scott. We knew they had to meet, and on Tuesday they chatted via video for more than 90 minutes about the creative process, criticism and what happens when their children disagree with their artistic tastes. Ulrich even stumped our critic when it came to movies. Here are edited excerpts from the conversation.A.O. SCOTT Be careful what you say to Rolling Stone, I guess.LARS ULRICH I woke up late that day, and I got a lot of activity in my inbox that morning from your tweet. So that was very cool. I’m in San Francisco. Are you in New York right now?
