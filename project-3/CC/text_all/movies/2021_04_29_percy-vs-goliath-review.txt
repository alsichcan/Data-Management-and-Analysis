‘Percy vs Goliath’ Review: Growing Pains
“Percy vs Goliath” might be based on a 1998 Canadian legal battle and its fallout, but Clark Johnson’s ambling, warmhearted movie doesn’t lean on courtroom tension for drama. Addressing high stakes — the degree to which agribusiness controls our food supply — in an extremely low key, Johnson uses one family’s plight to illustrate the predicament of an entire industry.Christopher Walken stars as Percy Schmeiser, a curmudgeonly canola farmer in Saskatchewan. Each year, Percy plants the legacy seeds his family has saved over generations, refusing to purchase the genetically modified, pesticide-resistant variety patented and sold by Monsanto. (The company has since been acquired by Bayer.) When Monsanto investigators discover his crop contains the modified gene (which Percy claims was an accidental contamination from a neighboring farm), Percy is vaulted into a yearslong struggle to protect his farm, his livelihood and, not least, his integrity.
