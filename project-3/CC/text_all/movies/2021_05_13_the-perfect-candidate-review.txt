‘The Perfect Candidate’ Review: Paving the Way
Women in Saudi Arabia were granted the right to drive in 2018. In “The Perfect Candidate,” a film made in 2019 that is only now being released here, Maryam (Mila Al Zahrani), a physician in a small town, is seen driving purposefully to destinations that include an airport. At that airport, she is refused permission to board a plane because her travel permit has expired. Said permit needs the approval of a guardian for renewal.That’s correct. Maryam — who is an expert diagnostician and deft surgeon, an excellent driver and a fully grown adult — can’t get on an airplane without her father’s permission.
