‘The Human Factor’ Review: In Peace Talks Trust Is Vital and Elusive
“The Human Factor” presents a cogent and involving view of the Israeli-Palestinian peace efforts, mainly from 1991 until the end of Bill Clinton’s first term, told through the recollections of United States negotiators charged with brokering a peace.

Ross here calls the “human factor.” As he says at the start of the film, in a negotiation, “You can’t ignore the human factor. Someone who has a human touch treats someone else with respect. Someone who has a human touch doesn’t think they’re going to outsmart anybody.”
