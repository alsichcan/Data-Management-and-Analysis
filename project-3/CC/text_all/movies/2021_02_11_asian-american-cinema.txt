A Vision of Asian-American Cinema That Questions the Very Premise
Nearly 40 years ago, the filmmaker Wayne Wang cobbled together $22,000 and shot his debut feature on the streets of San Francisco’s Chinatown. The result was “Chan Is Missing,” widely considered the first Asian-American indie film and a work that managed to be at once a vérité peek into a neighborhood, a sly neo-noir buddy film, and an experimental, complex allegory about Chinese-American identity — or, at least, about the ambivalence of it.That 1982 gem became an unlikely hit that broke through to the mainstream — only to be followed by a decades-long drought of similarly successful indies told with any sense of an Asian-American perspective. A few studio movies made waves, like Wang’s 1993 period drama, “The Joy Luck Club.” And then, in 2018, the blockbuster “Crazy Rich Asians” arrived with its all-Asian cast.The last few years have heralded a rush of bracing works helmed by a new generation of so-called Asian-American auteurs. But these films — like Justin Chon’s “Gook,” about the friendship between a Korean-American shoe store owner and a young Black girl, or Bing Liu’s “Minding the Gap,” a 2018 documentary about the hidden traumas of his Rockford, Ill., skateboarding friends — tell vastly different stories, some seemingly unconcerned with what we might consider Asian-American themes. The notion of Asian-American cinema, in short, has always been a bit of a flimsy concept. What makes these movies Asian-American?
