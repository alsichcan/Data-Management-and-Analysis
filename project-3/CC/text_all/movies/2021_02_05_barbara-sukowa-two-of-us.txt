Her Specialty Is Bringing Headstrong Women to Life Onscreen
There is a scene in the new drama “Two of Us” in which an older woman played by Barbara Sukowa is so angry, so desperate — and so determined — that after someone terminates a conversation by closing a door on her, she breaks a window to make a statement.“She wouldn’t just let the door be shut: She’s going to do something,” the director, Filippo Meneghetti, recalled.He tweaked the script on set to suit his star’s temperament, and you can see why: Sukowa, 71, has played a lot of headstrong women in her 40-year career, starting with an ambitious, social-climbing singer-slash-tart in her breakthrough, Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s biting satire “Lola” (1982). Some of the German actress’s signature parts have included a trilogy of sorts about passionate real-life intellectuals: the socialist activist and theoretician Rosa Luxemburg in the movie of the same name, the polymathic 12th-century nun Hildegard von Bingen in “Vision,” and the titular formidable political philosopher in “Hannah Arendt” (all from the director Margarethe von Trotta).
