He utters the line (more than once) after picking up Cassandra (Carey Mulligan). He had thought she was too drunk to rebuff him, and she turns out to be anything but. The movie is a kind of revenge tale with Cassandra at the center, but in some ways it defies easy genre categorization.With this sequence, the film’s writer and director, Emerald Fennell, said she was going for a subversion of the kind of scene typically found in romantic comedies, even casting Mintz-Plasse, whom audiences may best know from the comedy “Superbad.”
