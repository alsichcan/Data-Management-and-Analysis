When Co-Stars Compete at the Oscars, Who Wins?
[Follow our live coverage of 2021 Oscars.]When the Academy Award nominations were unveiled last month, the news that Lakeith Stanfield, seemingly the lead actor in “Judas and the Black Messiah,” was up for best supporting actor puzzled many of us, including Stanfield himself. He wrote on Instagram, “I’m confused too,” adding, “lmao.” Warner Bros. campaigned for Stanfield in the best actor category, but academy voters treat that as a mere suggestion, not a mandate.This categorization pits Stanfield directly against his “Judas” co-star Daniel Kaluuya, the 20th time a film has scored multiple nominations for supporting actor. But does the fact that Stanfield’s role is arguably bigger than Kaluuya’s give him a leg up in the Oscar race?The data from past Oscars can shed some light on this question — not just from the previous 19 times that two co-stars have appeared on the supporting actor list, but all 71 times it has happened in any acting category. In 48 of those instances, none of the nominees won the award, so they don’t help answer the question of whether bigger parts have an advantage. But the other 23 offer some insight.
