Golden Globes Movies Snubs: ‘Da 5 Bloods’ and Meryl Streep Are Shut Out
[Follow our live coverage of the 2021 Golden Globes.]With the Golden Globes, it’s best to expect the unexpected, and during an awards season this atypical, there’s an even higher chance of weird and wacky nominations. That’s why, though major movies like “Nomadland” and “The Trial of the Chicago 7” scored when the Golden Globe nominations were announced on Wednesday, it’s the out-of-left-field picks and startling exclusions that have everybody in Hollywood talking.Here are some of the Globes’ most notable snubs and surprises.“Da 5 Bloods”: Just two years after the Golden Globes gave Spike Lee a nice spread of four nominations for “BlacKkKlansman,” the group brutally snubbed his new film across the board: Lee’s Vietnam-veteran drama “Da 5 Bloods” earned no acting nominations (for Delroy Lindo or Chadwick Boseman) and was blanked in the drama, director, and screenplay categories, too. Making things even more awkward? Lee’s children Satchel and Jackson were chosen to serve as Golden Globe ambassadors this year, of all years.
