‘Chaos Walking’ Review: Just Thinking Out Loud
With their 1969 hit “In the Year 2525,” Zager and Evans speculated on future life: “if man is still alive/if woman can survive.” In “Chaos Walking,” it’s the year 2257, man is not-quite-thriving on a new planet, and woman is not around at all. In a place called Prentisstown, all the males try to manage their “noise” — that is, their thought, given audible and visible form, for sci-fi reasons — while maintaining a semblance of civilized life.Into this challenging environment falls a young woman. The sensitive P-Towner Todd (Tom Holland) notices her in part because women have no noise. He’s drawn to her silence.
