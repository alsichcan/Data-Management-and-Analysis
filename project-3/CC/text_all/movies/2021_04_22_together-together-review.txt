‘Together Together’ Review: A Conceivable Plan
Sweet, sensitive and surprisingly insightful, Nikole Beckwith’s “Together Together” fashions the signposts of the romantic comedy — the meet-cute, the misunderstanding, the mutual acceptance — into a wry examination of a very different relationship.A dialed-down Ed Helms plays Matt, a middle-aged app designer as square as his name and with an air of touching loneliness. Matt’s longing to have a child, previously stymied by uncooperative girlfriends, is about to be satisfied by Anna (a wonderful Patti Harrison), a 26-year-old barista who has agreed to be his surrogate. A contract has been drawn up and a fee agreed upon; what hasn’t been settled is how they will manage the next nine months.
