‘Long Live Rock … Celebrate the Chaos’ Review: An Ode to Metal
Aside from the sheer nostalgia of seeing large concert crowds thrashing with abandon (and without masks), the rock ‘n’ roll documentary “Long Live Rock … Celebrate the Chaos,” directed by a longtime music supervisor, Jonathan McHugh, lands on a minor note. Largely consisting of talking heads — from fans and noteworthy talent (Rob Zombie, Jonathan Davis, Ice-T) — the film aims to celebrate the uniqueness of the rock and metal communities, but ends up becoming a repetitive sound clip. Subjects claim that this fandom is different from others, but fail to articulate how. Instead, the sorest thumb that sticks out is the concentration of white fans in the scene.
