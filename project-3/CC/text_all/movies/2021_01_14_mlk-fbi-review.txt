‘MLK/FBI’ Review: King, Hoover and the Tale of the Tape
In some ways, “MLK/FBI,” Sam Pollard’s new documentary, tells a straightforward story suggested by the title. Drawing on long-secret documents — and anticipating the eventual release of recordings held in the National Archives — the film chronicles the F.B.I.’s surveillance and harassment of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.From the March on Washington in August 1963 until his assassination in April 1968, King was a subject of almost obsessive interest to the bureau and its director, J. Edgar Hoover. Reams of paper, miles of audio tape and countless hours were spent tracking the civil rights leader’s every action and utterance. Hoover viewed him as a singular threat to national security and was determined to diminish his influence.That much — including wiretaps and bugs in hotel rooms — is fairly well known. But Pollard, drawing on David J. Garrow’s controversial book “The FBI and Martin Luther King, Jr.: From ‘Solo’ to Memphis,” layers startling details about Hoover’s campaign against King with thoughtful interpretations of its meaning. The result is at once suspenseful, visually engrossing and intellectually bracing. It also raises urgent, sometimes uncomfortable questions about power, privacy and the ethical challenges of examining the past.Those challenges are signaled at the outset, as Garrow and other scholars — notably Beverly Gage of Yale and Donna Murch of Rutgers — ponder the status of the F.B.I. tapes, in particular those that reveal King’s sex life, as historical evidence. The recordings won’t be available until 2027, but they are generally believed to document frequent infidelities. Can the tapes be trusted? How will their contents affect King’s reputation? The answers offered by the experts are nuanced and cautious, with some — including former F.B.I. officials — arguing that it would be better if the tapes remained unheard.
