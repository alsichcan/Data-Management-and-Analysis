David Oyelowo Fights for Representation in Family Films
The actor David Oyelowo’s journey into the director’s chair took 20 years and one critical conversation with his oldest son.It was 2015 and Oyelowo was preparing to star in the family film “Queen of Katwe.” His four children had previously visited him on the set of “Selma,” where it appeared there was nothing their father couldn’t do. After all, it was Oyelowo who shaved his hairline and stood behind the pulpit, channeling the oratory skills of the singular Martin Luther King Jr.Now Oyelowo was turning his attention to a Disney movie, “Katwe,” and was excited to let his son know his father had finally landed at the ultimate childhood dream factory.“I told him and his first question to me was: ‘Wow, Daddy, that’s great. Are you going to be playing the best friend?’” Oyelowo recalled.
