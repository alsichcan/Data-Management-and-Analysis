‘Cherry’ Review: A Very Different Tangled Web for Tom Holland
A couple of years back, when Martin Scorsese dared to say he didn’t care for superhero movies — “that’s not cinema,” he said — two successful directors in that field, the brothers Joe and Anthony Russo, took a swipe at the older filmmaker. “At the end of the day, what do we know?” Joe said in an interview. “We’re just two guys from Cleveland, Ohio, and ‘cinema’ is a New York word.”Yet, from the evidence of their latest movie, “Cherry,” the Russos seem interested in making something akin to Scorsese cinema. A song by Van Morrison, a Scorsese favorite, plays over this movie’s opening credits, and other Morrison songs adorn its soundtrack. The protagonist is introduced as a young, alienated, fast-walking white man with a close-cropped haircut and a gun. Drug addiction figures in the action, and the action is often captured with involved camerawork. Hmm.
