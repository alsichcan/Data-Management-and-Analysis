Filmmakers Look at Woody Allen Abuse Allegations in Four-Part Series
The documentary filmmakers Kirby Dick and Amy Ziering have spent the past decade illuminating sexual abuse accusations in institutions like the military, in “The Invisible War” (2012); colleges, in “The Hunting Ground” (2015); and the music industry, in “On the Record” (2020). Now they have set their sights on Dylan Farrow’s decades-old sexual abuse allegations against her adoptive father, Woody Allen.“Allen v. Farrow” is a four-part docuseries set to debut later this month that takes viewers into Farrow’s public experience of accusing a famous and powerful man of abuse but also lays out details of the case that haven’t been shared with the public.Initially, Farrow’s story didn’t comport with Dick and Ziering’s usual broad-based investigations, but on closer examination the filmmakers found it offered them a chance to discuss familial child abuse and incest, a topic that survivors consistently asked the two to tackle.
