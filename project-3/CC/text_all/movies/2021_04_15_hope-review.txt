‘Hope’ Review: In Sickness and in Health
For audiences seeking escapism, this may not be the best time to tout a movie about terminal illness. Yet it might help to know that “Hope,” a largely autobiographical drama from the Norwegian writer and director Maria Sodahl, is neither miserabilist nor sappily sentimental. Instead, it’s an almost brutally honest observation of a calcified relationship forced to adjust to a terrifying new reality.Anja (Andrea Braein Hovig) and Tomas (Stellan Skarsgard) have a comfortable Oslo home, six children between them and a two-decade domestic partnership. A talented choreographer, Anja has neglected her career while Tomas, a theater director, has worked and traveled tirelessly. By the time Anja learns that the lung cancer she endured the previous year has metastasized to her brain and is likely incurable, the two have drifted so far apart that the survival of the relationship is as uncertain as her prognosis.
