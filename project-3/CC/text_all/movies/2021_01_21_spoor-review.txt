‘Spoor’ Review: Hunters in the Snow
“Spoor,” directed by the Polish filmmaker Agnieszka Holland and her daughter, Kasia Adamik, went nearly four years without an American release. At the New York Film Festival the fall after its February 2017 premiere, the critic Amy Taubin, one of its many champions, introduced it as perhaps her favorite film so far that decade. She has interpreted it as a politically charged critique of Polish patriarchy.Praise that high, for a feature that has not played widely in the United States, makes a skeptic want to leave a light footprint, especially after spending time in the film’s dark, snow-covered landscapes.
