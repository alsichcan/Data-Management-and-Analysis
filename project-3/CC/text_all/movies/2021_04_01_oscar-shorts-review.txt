‘The 2021 Oscar Nominated Short Films’ Review: Major Issues in Brief
This year, the Oscar-nominated short films are being presented in three programs: live action, animation and documentary. Each program is reviewed below by a separate critic.Short films have always been reliable vehicles for hit-and-run comedy, but you won’t find much to laugh about in the live action section of this year’s Oscar-nominated crop. Incarceration, police brutality, immigration — it’s a sociopolitical smorgasbord.All approach their sensitive subjects with originality and varying degrees of lightness. In “Two Distant Strangers,” the flashiest of the bunch and the most gut-punching, the directors Travon Free and Martin Desmond Roe send a cheery graphic designer (the rapper Joey Bada$$) through multiple “Groundhog Day” encounters with a murderous New York City police officer. Clever and sinewy and upsetting, this 29-minute nightmare wraps a meditation on fate and helplessness in gleaming primary colors and a buoyantly optimistic lead performance.
