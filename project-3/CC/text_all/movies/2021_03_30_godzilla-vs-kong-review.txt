‘Godzilla vs. Kong’ Review: Let’s You and Him Fight
A few nights ago, I watched “Godzilla vs. Kong” alone in my darkened living room. This was far from ideal, but it did make me acutely nostalgic for a specific pleasure that I have gone without for 13 months. There are many reasons I miss going to movie theaters, but one of them I hadn’t really taken account of is the particular delight of watching a bad movie on a big screen.I don’t mean “bad” in a bad way. It’s a description, rather than a judgment. “Godzilla vs. Kong,” directed by Adam Wingard, is the fourth episode in a franchise, called the MonsterVerse, engineered from fossilized B-movie DNA. As such, it assembles an impressive human cast to run around explaining fake science and calling attention to what is happening in plain sight. “Did the monkey just talk?” someone asks. He did, sort of, but that’s not what anybody is here to see. We paid money to watch him fight the lizard.
