‘White Lie’ Review: In Sickness and in Stealth
“White Lie” is something of a misnomer, given that the fraud that Katie (Kacey Rohl), a young college student, is perpetrating is far from victimless. Neither is it easy: The effort involved in pretending to have cancer consumes most of her energy (and all of the film’s 96 minutes). She looks exhausted, although — according to a crooked physician — not nearly enough to convince potential marks. Luckily, that’s a problem weight-loss medication can solve.Small in scale and gray in aspect, “White Lie,” written and directed by Yonah Lewis and Calvin Thomas, is a coolly indeterminate tease. Instead of a third act, this unusual Canadian drama simply continues Katie’s desperate sprint to stay one step ahead of exposure, and her frantic recalibration whenever her scam is threatened: A grant application requires falsified medical records; a social-media post demands panicked damage control.
