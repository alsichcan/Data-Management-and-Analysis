‘Cowboys’ Review: Abduction on Demand, by Horseback
The crisis for the couple at the heart of “Cowboys” begins when their son, Joe (Sasha Knight), expresses his desire to transition.In this Western-influenced family drama, the father, Troy (Steve Zahn), is happy to acknowledge his son’s identity, but Troy’s scatterbrained sweetness makes it hard for his wife, Sally (Jillian Bell), to see his support as anything more than indulgence. At home, Sally enforces girliness, and she wins custody when she and Troy separate.
