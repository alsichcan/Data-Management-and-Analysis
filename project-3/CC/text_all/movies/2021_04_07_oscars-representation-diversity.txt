Will People of Color Win All Four Acting Oscars This Year?
Five years after back-to-back bouts of #OscarsSoWhite put a spotlight on award-season diversity, could the Academy Awards be on the verge of a major breakthrough where people of color win every single acting trophy?There are no guarantees in this unusual year, but there is now a precedent: On Sunday, the Screen Actors Guild gave its lead-acting awards to the “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” stars Viola Davis and Chadwick Boseman, while the supporting-actor awards went to Daniel Kaluuya (“Judas and the Black Messiah”) and Yuh-Jung Youn (“Minari”).If the same people prevail at the Oscars — and over the last decade, the SAG quartet has held firm half the time — then it will be the first year in Oscar history that actors of color will have triumphed in all four acting races.But even if that record doesn’t fall, plenty more are poised to. Already, the lineup of acting nominees is the most diverse ever, and 70 women were nominated across 23 categories, a record. This year’s eclectic mix of newcomers and veterans practically ensures that Oscar history will be made when the 93rd Academy Awards ceremony is broadcast on April 25, and until then, here are some of the potential breakthroughs I’ll be keeping my eye on.
