‘Days of the Bagnold Summer’ Review:
Regrettably, this motion picture does not chronicle a book club devoting a season to the works of Enid Bagnold. In fact, no reference is made to the author of “The Chalk Garden” and “National Velvet.”Instead, “Days of the Bagnold Summer,” adapted from the Joff Winterhart graphic novel by the screenwriter Lisa Owens and the director Simon Bird, is a coming-of-age story that aspires to winsomeness and wisdom, but only gets so far.The British Bagnold family of the title here consists of Sue (Monica Dolan), a shy middle-aged single mother, and her son, Daniel (Earl Cave), a teen of zombielike pallor and limp hair. Daniel has a trip to Florida looming; there, he plans to spend time with his father, who’s ditched him and mom. The trip is canceled and the chip on Daniel’s shoulder practically triples in size.
