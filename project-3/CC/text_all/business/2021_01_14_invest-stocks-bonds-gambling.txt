How to Be a Better Investor: Do Nothing
My father was one of the smartest people I have ever met.He was also among the dumbest investors.The two facts are related.He went to N.Y.U. on a full scholarship, finished in two and a half years and taught cryptology in the Army after graduation — and was convinced he could outsmart the stock market.Dad was always buying penny stocks of companies that would “change the world” or investing in dubious tax shelters that always seemed to trigger an I.R.S. audit, and he was convinced that he could time the market.One reason he was so frenetic in his trading was he had time to do it. He held senior marketing positions in several major insurance companies, jobs that he didn’t find particularly taxing and that gave him plenty of free time, and he often used it to “play the market.”
