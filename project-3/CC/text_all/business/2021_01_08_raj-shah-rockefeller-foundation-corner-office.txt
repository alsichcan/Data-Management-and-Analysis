When Disaster Hits Home for a Global Aid Organization
Not long before the pandemic hit, Raj Shah, the president of the Rockefeller Foundation, was in a rural town in India to inspect a new solar-powered micro-grid funded by the foundation. At dusk, the government’s unreliable power system faltered, plunging the town into darkness. Moments later, the lights came back on, this time powered by the micro-grid.Mr. Shah, whose parents immigrated from India to the United States, was there with his daughter. “She looked up and was like, ‘Wow, that’s awesome,’” he remembered. “I think it’s the first time in her life she thought her dad was doing something useful.”Mr. Shah has been trying to engineer small victories like that for his entire career. A precocious child who was interested in public health from an early age, he became a doctor and earned an advanced degree in health economics. Mr. Shah then went to work for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2001. While there, he helped with the foundation’s efforts to distribute vaccines in poor countries.In 2009, he joined the Obama administration, and quickly rose to become administrator of the United States Agency for International Development, or U.S.A.I.D. In that role, he was deeply involved in the U.S. government’s response to the 2014 Ebola outbreak in Africa. Soon after leaving U.S.A.I.D., he was part of the United Nations group that reviewed the world’s readiness for a pandemic.
