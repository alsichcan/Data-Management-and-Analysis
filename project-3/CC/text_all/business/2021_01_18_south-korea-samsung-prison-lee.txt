Questions Hover Over Samsung as Chief Returns to Prison for Bribery
SEOUL, South Korea — ​Lee Jae-yong, chief of the sprawling Samsung conglomerate, returned to prison on Monday for bribing a former South Korean president, leaving major questions hanging over the fate of one of the world’s largest business empires.The Seoul High Court sentenced Mr. Lee earlier on Monday to two and a half years in prison for bribing Park Gyun-hye, the president who was impeached in 2016 on corruption charges. He will serve only one and a half years because he had already spent about a year in jail on previous charges tied to the case.“Your Honor, I have nothing to say,” Mr. Lee said when the presiding judge gave him a chance to make a final statement before being arraigned and whisked away to prison on Monday.The new sentence deals a blow to Samsung, a corporate leviathan that touches many aspects of South Korean life. It is the biggest and most lucrative of a handful of family-controlled conglomerates, or chaebol, that dominate South Korea’s economy. The group’s electronics unit, Samsung Electronics, accounts for nearly one-fifth of the country’s total exports.
