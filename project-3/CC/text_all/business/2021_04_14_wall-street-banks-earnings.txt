With Earnings Soaring, Wall Street Banks See Economic Boom Ahead
The mood on Wall Street is decidedly jubilant.Just a year ago, as the coronavirus raged across the country, the nation’s largest banks were anticipating economic devastation. They set aside billions of dollars to gird against the huge losses that could follow, as record numbers of people lost their jobs, office buildings emptied out and small businesses closed.It’s an entirely different story today. On Wednesday, executives at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo delivered a bullish economic forecast. They said that consumers — their wallets padded by stimulus money — are itching to spend and companies are rushing to expand by buying or building new businesses, as the United States emerges from the Covid-19 pandemic.“It is clear to me that the U.S. is poised for a strong recovery this year, led by consumer spending that is rebounding to pre-Covid levels,” David M. Solomon, chief executive of Goldman Sachs, told analysts on a conference call. “This sentiment is reflected in the capital markets.”Jamie Dimon, his counterpart at JPMorgan Chase, the country’s largest bank by assets, took a similar view. “We believe that the economy has the potential to have extremely robust, multiyear growth,” Mr. Dimon said in a statement. He attributed his outlook to government spending on stimulus and infrastructure, supportive policies from the Federal Reserve and high hopes for the end of the pandemic.
