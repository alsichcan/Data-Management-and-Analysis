Reese’s New Peanut Butter Cup Is (Almost) All Peanut Butter
“Two great tastes that taste great together,” the Hershey Company said for years, on national TV. “Still perfect,” it boasted in the new century, assuring the public that the marriage of salty peanut butter and sweet milk chocolate was unchanged.Now, Hershey is releasing a version of its Reese’s Peanut Butter Cups with peanut butter alone, raising questions for consumers: Is a peanut butter cup still a Reese’s without a chocolate shell? Or is it just a wedge of peanut butter in a little paper cup?In an announcement this week, Hershey expressed no misgivings about the new version of its peanut butter cups.“Yes, that’s right,” Hershey said in a statement on Monday. “We said no chocolate.”The company will produce miniature-, standard- and king-size peanut butter cups without chocolate, returning a product that had limited runs last year and the year before. The new candy’s official website goes live on Thursday.
