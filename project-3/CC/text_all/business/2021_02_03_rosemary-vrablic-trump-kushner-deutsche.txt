Trump’s Banker at Deutsche Bank Was Ousted for a Real Estate Deal
Former President Donald J. Trump’s longtime banker at Deutsche Bank was pushed out of her job in December following an internal investigation that concluded that she did business with a client without properly disclosing it, according to regulatory records that were made public on Wednesday.Deutsche Bank’s review found that Rosemary Vrablic, a senior private banker and managing director in its wealth management business in New York, “engaged in undisclosed activities related to a real estate investment,” including buying a property “from a client-managed entity,” the bank said in records filed with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority.The records said Ms. Vrablic, who left the bank in December, was “permitted to resign.”Deutsche Bank’s internal review concerned a 2013 real estate transaction between Ms. Vrablic and a company, Bergel 715 Associates. Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump’s son-in-law and senior White House adviser, held at least a small ownership stake in Bergel 715, according to a financial disclosure report he filed with the government last summer.The bank’s investigation began last year after The New York Times reported that Ms. Vrablic and two of her colleagues had bought an apartment in a Park Avenue building for about $1.5 million.
