Stay safe, everyone. — Charlotte CowlesPresident Joseph R. Biden Jr. began his first days in office by signing a flurry of executive orders to bolster the flagging economy and help those worst hit. He directed his administration to speed up the delivery of stimulus checks to the millions of eligible Americans who still haven’t gotten them, increase the weekly value of food stamps by up to 20 percent and raise the minimum wage of federal workers to $15 an hour. A day earlier, he moved to prolong the existing federal ban on evictions to the end of March at the earliest (it was previously set to expire this month), along with the moratorium on foreclosures on federally guaranteed mortgages. He is also extending the freeze on federal student loan payments to the end of September.The social networking app Parler, which had become a hub for right-wing conspiracy theorists, won’t be back online anytime soon. A federal judge ruled against Parler’s lawsuit to force Amazon to restore the app’s platform this past week, stating it was not in the public interest. Amazon previously supplied Parler’s cloud computing services (as it does for many companies), but revoked them after Parler was used to coordinate the pro-Trump riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6. Parler accused Amazon of colluding with Twitter to drive it offline, but could not provide sufficient evidence. The judge also stated that until Parler instituted a better system to moderate “abusive, violent content,” the court would not compel Amazon to host it.
