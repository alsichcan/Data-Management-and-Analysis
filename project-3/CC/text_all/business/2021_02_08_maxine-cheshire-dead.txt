Maxine Cheshire, Who Chronicled Beltway Scandals, Dies at 90
The first time Maxine Cheshire encountered Jacqueline Kennedy, then a young senator’s wife, at the Democratic National Convention in 1956, Mrs. Kennedy ran away, setting in motion a pattern that would continue throughout the years that Ms. Cheshire covered her as a star society reporter at The Washington Post.Ms. Cheshire, she later recalled, would go on to make Mrs. Kennedy cry when she became first lady — prompting her husband to call Phil Graham, The Post’s publisher, with his wife sobbing in the background — in response to a series about Mrs. Kennedy’s redecorating of the White House, which noted that its budget was enormous and that some of the antiques in the finished scheme were fakes.Ms. Cheshire was no kid-glove-wearing party hack.“That hillbilly reporter,” as President Kennedy called her — her colleagues called her Max — had cut her teeth on the police beat at a paper in Tennessee. And her training, along with the baked-in moxie, luck and doggedness of Rosalind Russell in “His Girl Friday,” made Ms. Cheshire’s reporting required reading across the Beltway and beyond.She often broke international scandals — influence peddling among South Korean operatives, for example, or the Nixon family’s attempts to hide hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of jewels, given them by the shah of Iran and others, in the middle of the Watergate scandal — through her work on the so-called women’s pages that were The Post’s vaunted Style section. She won multiple awards for her investigations.
