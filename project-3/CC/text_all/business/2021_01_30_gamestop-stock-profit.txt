A 10-Year-Old GameStop Investor Cashed In. His Return? Over 5,000%.
As amateur investors banded together this week to squeeze Wall Street hedge funds by sending GameStop’s stock prices to dizzying heights, some novice traders, like 10-year-old Jaydyn Carr of San Antonio, have seen their long-term investments pay off.In December 2019, Jaydyn, then 8, was buying discounted games at GameStop and wishing for an Xbox One. Spying a way to use her son’s enthusiasm for video games to teach him about investing, Jaydyn’s mother, Nina Carr, decided to invest in 10 shares of GameStop at $6.19 a share for a Kwanzaa gift.Ms. Carr handed her son a certificate she created from an online template to explain to him that he was the owner of a tiny part of GameStop. She told him the gift was in keeping with the spirit of ujamaa, or cooperative economics, one of the seven principles of Kwanzaa.She added alerts on her phone and computer to track the stock’s progress. Over the past few months, she noticed it steadily rise. But on Wednesday, to the shock of Ms. Carr and her son, the value of GameStop shares surged, soaring 1,700 percent since December after millions of small investors, many spurred on by social media, came together to put a squeeze on at least two hedge funds that had bet GameStop’s shares would collapse.
