Berkshire Hathaway’s Earnings Slowed Last Year
Thanks to its huge collection of businesses — from insurance to railroads to candy — Warren E. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is often seen as a barometer for the American economy.And in that respect, its performance last year mirrored the country’s economic performance as a whole.Berkshire reported on Saturday that it earned $45.2 billion for 2020, down 48 percent from the previous year, while its operating earnings fell. But while the pandemic had hurt many of its business lines — and forced Berkshire to again stage its forthcoming annual meeting as an online-only event, this time in Los Angeles — its profits rose 23 percent in the fourth quarter, as its stock investments were bolstered by soaring markets.Among the biggest winners in Berkshire’s vast investment portfolio was its 5.4 percent stake in Apple, whose shares have been among the top market winners over the past year. In his annual letter to investors that accompanied the company’s financial results, Mr. Buffett noted that the iPhone maker was now one of his company’s three biggest assets, with its stake worth $120 billion as of Dec. 31. (Berkshire calculates that it paid $31 billion for its holdings.)
