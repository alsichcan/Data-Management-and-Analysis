The Week in Business: Happy New Year, Here’s $600
Welcome to 2021. The next few months may not be any easier than the last, but let’s take it one week at a time. Here’s the business and tech news you need to know for the days ahead. — Charlotte CowlesUnder mounting pressure from both parties, President Trump on Dec. 27 finally signed a $900 billion pandemic bailout package, which he had previously opposed. The bill, which took months of haggling in Congress, averted a government shutdown and provided billions of dollars in coronavirus aid to hospitals, schools, businesses and American families. By delaying his signature, Mr. Trump allowed two pandemic-related unemployment assistance programs to expire, imperiling the livelihoods of millions of Americans. The new legislation reinstated them.The aid bill may be official, but Congress is still debating one of its provisions: the direct-payment stimulus checks. Should they be $600 each, as the bill originally stated, or $2,000, as Mr. Trump has demanded? Democrats were more than happy to oblige Mr. Trump’s push for higher payments, putting Republicans in the awkward position of defying the president if they disagreed. But the Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, said there was “no realistic path” for the proposal, which he effectively managed to block by tacking on two other measures that Democrats would never agree to, including an investigation of the integrity of the 2020 election. The $600 payments started going out to Americans last week, and most recipients are expected to save the money rather than spend it and boost the economy.
