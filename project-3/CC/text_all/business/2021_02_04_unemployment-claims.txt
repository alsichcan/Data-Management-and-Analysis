Unemployment Claims Fall, but Labor Market Remains Turbulent
The American economy has shaken off the worst of the recent layoff surge, government figures indicated Thursday, but the job market remains daunting.The Labor Department reported that new claims for state unemployment benefits fell last week for the third straight week. But filings are still extraordinarily high by historical standards, a sign of the pandemic’s tenacious economic grip.The slight improvement comes as the Biden administration pushes for a coronavirus relief package valued at $1.9 trillion. Benefit extensions included in a $900 billion measure approved in December are set to expire for many unemployed workers in mid-March.Last week brought 816,000 new claims for state benefits, down from 840,000 the previous week. Adjusted for seasonal variations, last week’s figure was 779,000, a decrease of 33,000.
