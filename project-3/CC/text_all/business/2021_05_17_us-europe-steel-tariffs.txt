U.S. and Europe Seek to End Trump-Era Dispute Over Steel and Aluminum
The United States and the European Union said Monday they had begun discussions to resolve a conflict over steel and aluminum imports that was a major front in the Trump administrationâ€™s trade wars and a serious burden on trans-Atlantic relations.The talks are part of an effort by the Biden administration to rebuild relations between the United States and Europe after the Trump administration treated the bloc like an adversary, sometimes threatening to leave NATO and citing national security as a justification for charging 25 percent tariffs on imports of European steel and 10 percent on aluminum.That action prompted the European Union to charge similar duties on U.S. products like bourbon, orange juice and motorcycles.The thaw announced Monday, which will prevent steeper tariffs from taking affect, will also make it easier for the United States and Europe to work together to rein in China.
