CBS News Names 2 Outsiders to Succeed Its President
Two years ago, CBS picked the ultimate insider to run its broadcast news division: Susan Zirinsky, whose decades-long tenure at the network stretched to the days of Walter Cronkite.Now the network is turning to a pair of outsiders — one from the world of newspapers and digital publishing — to restore the fortunes of a news operation that trails its rivals at ABC and NBC.CBS said on Thursday that Neeraj Khemlani, a vice president at the publishing powerhouse Hearst, and Wendy McMahon, a former ABC executive, would succeed Ms. Zirinsky. The two will serve as presidents and co-heads of CBS News, a division that will be expanded to include local stations owned by the network.In the gossipy world of TV news, neither executive had been rumored to be a candidate for the top CBS role.
