Congress hears testimony again on GameStop, focusing on the financial plumbing behind the frenzy.
The House Financial Services Committee’s second hearing on the January stock market frenzy surrounding GameStop again focused on the practice that had given rise to commission-free trading apps and allowed trading by individual investors to boom.In a practice known as payment-for-order-flow, large trading operations such as Citadel Securities and Virtu Financial pay retail brokerage firms — such as Robinhood — to execute orders. The surge in retail trading has moved such firms, which long have operated in relative anonymity, into a central role in the American stock market.The arrangement can be lucrative: The firms essentially make small profits measured in increments of pennies on such trades, but the enormous user base of commission-free brokerage firms means those tiny profits can quickly add up.Citadel Securities, a large wholesale brokerage firm that trades a range of securities such as bonds, stocks and derivatives, says it executes 47 percent of all retail trading of U.S.-listed stocks.
