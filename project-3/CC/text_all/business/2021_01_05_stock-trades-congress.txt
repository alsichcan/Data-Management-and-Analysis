A Simple Way to End Questionable Stock Trading by Lawmakers
After Senator Kelly Loeffler, Republican of Georgia, was investigated over insider trading claims last spring, along with at least three of her colleagues, she announced that she and her husband would no longer trade individual stocks; her family would divest them and move their money into diversified mutual funds.Ms. Loeffler, one of the two Republican candidates in Georgia’s Senate runoff elections on Tuesday, was publicly pressured to do what Congress had long resisted requiring of its members: stop trading individual company stocks.After she was involved in key meetings early in the pandemic, she sold some stocks just before they lost significant value. Ms. Loeffler denied wrongdoing, and the investigation ended without prosecution. With that — and amid a heated presidential election — any momentum to pass new legislation to prevent persistent questions about whether lawmakers were profiting from trading individual stocks was lost.“Congress clearly isn’t doing enough to police its members, so what other options to restore basic integrity are on the table?” asked Tyler Gellasch, a former member of Senator Carl Levin’s staff who helped draft the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge Act of 2012. Mr. Gellasch, who is now the executive director of the Healthy Markets Association, says that STOCK Act, which makes it illegal to use inside information to trade but does not preclude lawmakers from buying or selling individual stocks, “was never going to be enough.”
