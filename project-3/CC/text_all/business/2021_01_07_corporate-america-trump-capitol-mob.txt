After Riot, Business Leaders Reckon With Their Support for Trump
Big business struck a Faustian bargain with President Trump.When he said something incendiary or flirted with authoritarianism, high-minded chief executives would issue vague, moralizing statements and try to distance themselves from a pro-business president who coveted their approval.But when Mr. Trump cut taxes, rolled back onerous regulations or used them as props for a photo op, they would applaud his leadership and grin for the cameras.After Wednesdayâ€™s events on Capitol Hill, the true cost of that balancing act was plain to see, even through the tear gas wafting in the rotunda.The executives who stood by Mr. Trump were ultimately among his enablers, bestowing him with the imprimatur of mainstream business credibility and normalizing a president who has turned the country against itself.
