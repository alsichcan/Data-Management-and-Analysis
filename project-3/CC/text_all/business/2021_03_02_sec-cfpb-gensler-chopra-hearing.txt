Biden’s Picks for Financial Regulator Jobs Emphasize Transparency and Fairness
President Biden’s picks to lead two important regulatory agencies — the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau — stressed twin goals of transparency and oversight of powerful interests on Tuesday, emphasizing that those who break laws must be held accountable for their actions.In a wide-ranging hearing before the Senate Banking Committee, the S.E.C. nominee, Gary Gensler, and the consumer bureau nominee, Rohit Chopra, laid out details of their positions on issues including climate change, stock market volatility, student loans and cryptocurrencies.Facing questions from Republicans suspicious that Mr. Biden might use regulatory agencies to push liberal policies, the two nominees insisted they would not stretch the power given to the agencies — but were firm about how they would wield it.Mr. Gensler, for example, defended the need for companies to disclose climate risks and diversity efforts, saying those topics are top of mind for many investors. “I do think diversity in boards and senior leadership benefits decision-making and it’s something I am committed to at the S.E.C.,” said Mr. Gensler.
