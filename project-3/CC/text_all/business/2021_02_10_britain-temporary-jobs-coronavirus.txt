‘I Did Something Useful’: Unemployed Workers Take On the Virus in Temp Jobs
LONDON — Georgia Paget was an assistant stage manager at London’s production of “Hamilton.” David Lawrence was directing choruses and orchestras throughout Britain. Katy Oakden, a onetime equine midwife, was managing a busy veterinary practice. Mark Karrie, a sound engineer, had just begun a national tour for a West End musical.Their jobs, like those of millions of others — restaurant cooks, hotel chambermaids, airline pilots, librarians and many more — suddenly came to a stop when the pandemic struck Britain last spring.Now they are part of the small army of thousands who have taken a role to fight the virus, hired by the National Health Service and private firms contracted by the government to assist in temporary jobs like cleaning hospital wards, spreading the word on self-isolation rules and administering tests for coronavirus.The N.H.S. is revered by the British public for valiantly providing frontline medical care during the pandemic, but the government’s use of outsourcing companies has drawn criticism for mismanagement. After the country’s first lockdown, a 108 million-pound contract (about $136 million) to hire contact tracers was awarded without real competition. In August, thousands of contact tracing jobs were scrapped after complaints of having no one to call.
