MyPillow C.E.O. Mike Lindell Sued by Dominion Over Election Fraud Claims
Dominion Voting Systems sued Mike Lindell, chief executive of MyPillow, on Monday, alleging that he defamed Dominion with baseless claims of election fraud involving its voting machines. The company is seeking more than $1.3 billion in damages.The complaint, which was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia and also named MyPillow, alleged that Mr. Lindell “exploited” false claims about election fraud to support his company’s sales.“Lindell — a talented salesman and former professional card counter — sells the lie to this day because the lie sells pillows,” Dominion said in the filing. It said MyPillow’s “defamatory marketing campaign” — with promo codes like “FightforTrump” and “QAnon” — had increased the company’s sales 30 percent to 40 percent.“I’m very happy that they’ve done this,” Mr. Lindell said in a phone interview on Monday. “I’m ready to go to court. I have all the evidence that anyone would ever want to see.”
