Tennessee Fires Football Coach Amid Investigation
The University of Tennessee fired Jeremy Pruitt, its head football coach, and nine other staff members after the school investigated whether the program violated N.C.A.A. recruitment regulations, the school announced Monday.The firings go into effect on Tuesday.In November, the university started an investigation in collaboration with a law firm, Bond, Schoeneck & King, to determine if the football program had broken N.C.A.A. rules while recruiting candidates for its team, finding that “Coach Pruitt did not meet the university’s expectations for promoting an atmosphere of compliance and/or monitoring the activities of the coaches and staff who report to him.”Among those fired were assistant football coaches Brian Niedermeyer and Shelton Felton, four members of the football team’s on-campus recruitment staff, the director and assistant director of football player personnel, and a football quality control coach.“What is so disturbing, as demonstrated by the scope of these actions, is the number of violations and people involved and their efforts to conceal their activities from our compliance staff and from the Athletic department’s leaders,” Donde Plowman, the school’s chancellor, said in a news release. “Despite a strong compliance culture in our athletic department, we must look for ways to further strengthen our processes.”
