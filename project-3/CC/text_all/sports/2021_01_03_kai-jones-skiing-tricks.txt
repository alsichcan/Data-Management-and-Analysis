This 14-Year-Old Ski Daredevil Is Already a Pro, and Trying Not to Scare His Parents
JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. — Kai Jones, who at 14 is already a professional adventure skier with the videos to prove it, likes to reminisce about the old days.Like, when he was an 11-year-old sixth grader. His goal then, aside from seventh grade, was preparing for his first leap off a menacing, craggy, 35-foot mountain cliff in Wyoming backcountry known as “Smart Bastard.”“I had butterflies in my stomach — looking over the edge was intimidating,” Kai said last month, still in ski boots following a lightning dash down the slopes of the Jackson Hole resort near his home. “But you close your eyes and envision the approach you’ve planned. You open your eyes and hope for the best, but you know it’s going to work out because you’ve put in the time to study it.”Airborne for three seconds, Kai nailed the jump, landing in a splash of snow that temporarily enveloped his four-foot-plus frame. As cameras rolled, he emerged from the powdery plume to carve deft, buttery turns in the ultra-steep landscape beneath the famed rocky precipice.
