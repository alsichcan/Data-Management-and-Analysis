The N.H.L. Schedule Is Shaky, but McDavid and Draisaitl Are Steady
In the month ahead, the N.H.L. plans to employ the serene scenes of Lake Tahoe as a backdrop for two outdoor games. But the 19 days of competition in January brought a bit of chaos to the league’s schedule.Since the season began on Jan. 13, dozens of players have been placed on the Covid-19 protocol-related absence list, which includes players who test positive and those who are being monitored because of close contact with someone who tested positive.Despite the format changes and shortened schedule, the season has had its share of constants. Most of the league’s top teams from last season have continued to thrive, and superlative performers like Edmonton’s Connor McDavid and Leon Draisaitl raised their scoring pace to seldom-seen levels, continuing their offensive dominance from last season.All statistics and standings are updated entering Thursday’s games.The N.H.L. had a rocky path to resumption, and the turbulence did not end once the parameters of the 2021 season were set.
