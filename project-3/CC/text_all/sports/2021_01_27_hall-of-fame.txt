What More Do Voters Want? A History of Hall of Fame Snubs
There are few things more perfect than a Sunday afternoon in Cooperstown, N.Y., as members of the newest class of the Baseball Hall of Fame take turns speaking in front of their fellow Hall of Famers and an enormous crowd of fans, any of whom are free to simply walk up on the day of the event. There is usually plenty of room to spare.But this year, as in 2013, none of the 25 finalists appeared on the required 75 percent of the ballots of the eligible voters from the Baseball Writers’ Association of America. It was the ninth time that not a single player had gained election through the writers’ annual vote, and with the Hall’s eras committees having delayed a vote because of the pandemic, it ensured that no players would be elected at all this year.No Barry Bonds. No Roger Clemens. No Curt Schilling.The good news for fans is that the Hall of Fame plans to hold an induction ceremony on July 25 for the class of 2020, which had its ceremony canceled last summer. And the good news for the players who were snubbed on this year’s ballot is that history suggests quite a few of them will eventually become Hall of Famers.
