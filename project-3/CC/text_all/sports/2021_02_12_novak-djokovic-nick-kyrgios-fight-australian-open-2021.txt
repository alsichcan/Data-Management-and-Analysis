Novak Djokovic and Nick Kyrgios Trade Shots Off the Court
MELBOURNE, Australia — Novak Djokovic’s flat verbal volley was catnip for Nick Kyrgios, who gleefully blasted a return. “Bang,” he muttered under his breath, “Nailed him.”Kyrgios made his point at an Australian Open news conference, not on the court, where he last faced Djokovic in 2017. Over months and across time zones, the men have engaged in what amounts to the longest rally of the season, a seesaw of snark that has captivated an audience drawn to the catty Real Housewives of Melbourne vibe.Kyrgios called Djokovic “a tool.” Djokovic said he has no respect for Kyrgios off the court. Kyrgios called Djokovic “a very strange cat.” A weary Djokovic sighed and said, “Great.”The ball was back in Kyrgios’s court on Wednesday, but he was too exhausted after his electrifying five-set comeback victory over the 29th-seeded Frenchman, Ugo Humbert, to take another swipe at Djokovic, who is also through to Friday’s third round.
