Pitchers Beware: Giancarlo Stanton Is Feeling Strong
As his Yankees teammates watched Giancarlo Stanton rocket ball after ball out of the batter’s box, day after day during spring training, it often felt like October again. Stanton was happy and healthy then, crushing home run after home run while carrying the Yankees to within one win of the American League Championship Series.“My gosh, I mean the home runs he was hitting weren’t just home runs but light-tower home runs,” Yankees first baseman Luke Voit said, adding: “The only problem is that I hit behind him and when he hits those balls so far, I’m like, ‘All right, I’ve got to do the same thing.’ And I ended up striking out.”Stanton has not always looked or felt that good since the Miami Marlins offloaded him and his huge contract onto the Yankees after his award-winning 2017 season. Because of repeated injuries, Stanton, one of the fittest and strongest players in baseball, has appeared in roughly half of his team’s games since his move to New York. And when he was in the lineup during past postseasons, he hadn’t contributed much, either.That changed last season, as did his leadership role within the team on important social issues. And now, fresh off that big October, he is looking for an even bigger year.
