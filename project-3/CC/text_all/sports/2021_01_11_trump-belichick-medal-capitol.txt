Patriots’ Belichick Declines Honor From Trump
[Follow our live Brown vs. Chiefs and Buccaneers vs. Saints coverage.]New England Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said in a statement Monday that he had turned down the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Trump because of the “tragic events of last week,” a reference to the rampage at the Capitol.In a statement, Belichick said he was flattered to be nominated for the award, the highest civilian honor in the country, because of its past recipients. But he said he has great reverence for “our nation’s values,” represents his family and the Patriots, and has worked with his players to combat social injustice.“Continuing those efforts while remaining true to the people, team and country that I love outweigh the benefits of any individual award,” he wrote in a statement.With just days left in his term, Trump had planned to give Belichick the Presidential Medal of Freedom on Thursday, setting off questions about whether Belichick would accept it after the riots at the Capitol last week plunged the country into a political crisis that could include Trump’s second impeachment.
