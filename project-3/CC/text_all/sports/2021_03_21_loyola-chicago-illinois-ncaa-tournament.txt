The Loyola-Chicago Ramblers, and Sister Jean, Return to the Round of 16
INDIANAPOLIS — Over the last year, there has been a greater appreciation for so many of life’s routine pleasures, particularly communal experiences — dinner with friends, a night at the movies, a day at the ballpark, holidays with family. For Cameron Krutwig, and so many other college basketball players, it was for an elemental joy that they have treasured more than ever: the bounce of a ball on hardwood and the sweat equity built only through competition.Krutwig had already been a member of an N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament darling as a freshman center riding with his Loyola University Chicago teammates to the Final Four in 2018, capturing hearts with their spirit and the presence of their irrepressible team chaplain, Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt.It was, especially for a university like Loyola, which sits on the banks of Lake Michigan and in the shadow of nearby Northwestern, supposed to be the trip of a lifetime.Now, in a season played in a pandemic, the Ramblers, with Krutwig leading the way, are attempting to reprise that run. Loyola Chicago, the No. 8 seed, made it halfway to the Final Four on Sunday by knocking out No. 1-seeded Illinois with a 71-58 victory that was every bit as convincing as the score might suggest.
