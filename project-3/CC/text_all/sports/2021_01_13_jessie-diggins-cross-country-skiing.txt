The Olympics Were No Fluke. American Women Are Excelling in Cross-Country Skiing.
After Jessie Diggins crossed the finish line of the Tour de Ski cross-country race in Val di Fiemme, Italy, she collapsed onto her belly with arms and legs splayed on the snow, body heaving. A grueling eight-stage race held over 10 days, the Tour de Ski is the World Cup cross-country ski circuit’s marquee event and, by most accounts, its toughest.No American had ever won the 15-year-old event until Diggins did so on Sunday.And in Stage 3 of the tour last week, she and her teammate Rosie Brennan finished first and second in a 10-kilometer freestyle pursuit, becoming the first Americans to take the top two spots on the podium in a World Cup cross-country race. Two days later, they did it again in Stage 4’s 10-kilometer individual freestyle race.“It was such a true, collaborative effort,” Diggins, 29, said. “My first thought is gratitude to the greater team and all the learning and benefiting from the generations that came before.”
