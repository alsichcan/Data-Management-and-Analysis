For a Preview of What the N.C.A.A. Hopes to Pull Off, Look to Las Vegas
Of all the anomalous protocols, strategies and workarounds that have been put in place to stage the N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments during the pandemic, consider what Las Vegas’s McCarran International Airport might look like this weekend with charter jets lined up on the tarmac like cabs outside a La Guardia taxi stand.The routine will be vastly different from the usual scenes of teams celebrating the televised bracket reveals — on Sunday night for the men and Monday night for the women — and then spending a few days practicing and studying film back on their campuses before traveling to one of many sites spread all over the United States.Most teams, whether they qualify for the national tournament automatically by winning their conference championship or via an at-large berth, will travel by flight or bus directly from their conference tournament site to Indianapolis for the men and San Antonio for the women. The cities will host the N.C.A.A.’s first tournaments contained to one metropolitan area.The idea is to allow teams to tunnel from what they hope is one virus-free environment to another. Thus, the N.C.A.A. is commissioning armadas of planes and buses around the country to transport teams.
