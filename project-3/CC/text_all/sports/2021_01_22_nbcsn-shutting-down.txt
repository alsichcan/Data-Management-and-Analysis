NBC Sports Network Will Shut Down to Bolster Peacock Streaming Service
NBCUniversal will shut down its NBC Sports Network cable channel by the end of the year, according to an internal memo obtained by The New York Times, and move some of its sports programming to USA Network and the Peacock streaming service.The move will shutter a reliable stream of revenue for the company — NBCSN brings in hundreds of millions of dollars annually — in order to help build Peacock into a bona fide competitor to other streaming services, like Netflix and Disney+, and to shore up the USA Network.The changes signal that the traditional cable bundle, which has lost tens of millions of subscribers over the past decade to cord cutting but has been kept afloat largely by live sports programming, may soon lose some of that ballast, too. They also continue a trend of consolidation among cable channels, as cable operators seek to curtail the hefty fees they have to pay the networks to carry them.Some of NBCUniversal’s biggest sports franchises will soon appear on USA Network, according to the memo, which was sent by Pete Bevacqua, chairman of the NBC Sports Group.
