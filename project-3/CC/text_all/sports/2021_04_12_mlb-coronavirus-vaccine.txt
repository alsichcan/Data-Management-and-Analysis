M.L.B. Pushes Incentives to Encourage Players to Get Vaccine
A few days after going to a grocery store over the winter, Milwaukee Brewers reliever Brent Suter woke up feeling off. As the day went on, he grew tired and achy, and his back stiffened. He tested positive for the coronavirus the next day, and so did his wife soon after. Suter, 31, said his lungs were inflamed, and he lost his sense of smell and taste for two weeks. He paused his off-season throwing.“I’ve been sicker in my life, but I’ve never been that out of it that long,” Suter said in a video news conference last week. He added later, “Not a fun 10 days.”With that experience in mind, and after consulting with team and independent doctors, Suter said the decision to stick out his right shoulder — his nonthrowing arm, to be sure — for a Covid-19 vaccine was easy. Wearing masks and practicing social distancing are to curb the virus, he said, “but now we can beat this thing.”Vaccination rollouts are in full swing, and the Biden administration has directed state, local and tribal governments to make all adults eligible for Covid-19 vaccines by next Monday. But not everyone is eager to be vaccinated, including baseball players, despite additional incentives offered by their own union and the league.
