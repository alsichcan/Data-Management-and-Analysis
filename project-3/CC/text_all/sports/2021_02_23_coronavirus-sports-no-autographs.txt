The Pandemic Has Diminished Part of Athletes’ Jobs: Signing Autographs
The tennis player Eugenie Bouchard grew accustomed to drawing a crowd of autograph seekers. At tournaments, she routinely scribbled her signature for almost anybody who asked around stadium concourses or outside her hotel.Bouchard, a 2014 Wimbledon finalist who ranked fifth in the world at her peak, is one of Canada’s most popular athletes. But lately, she has received significantly less attention. She has competed in just four tournaments on the tour since the start of the coronavirus pandemic — sometimes without fans in the stands. Bouchard, 26, said she could count on one hand how many times she had been approached in public for an autograph on any given day in Las Vegas, where she has been training for nearly a year.“Very, very few,” she said in an email. “It’s like a special occasion now, and I get super excited to sign.”The pandemic has disrupted almost every aspect of sports culture, including fan attendance at games. Even where there are reduced-capacity crowds, buffers between spectators and players have largely prevented interactions, including one of professional athletes’ traditional responsibilities: giving autographs.
