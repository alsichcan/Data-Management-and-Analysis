Mets Sending Jacob deGrom to Injured List After a ‘Clean’ M.R.I.
After the entire Mets organization and their fans spent much of Monday nervously awaiting word about the status of pitcher Jacob deGrom, the team’s most important player, they received a good report — or at least one that was not too alarming.The Mets said that deGrom, who was off to one of the most dominant season starts in his superb career, underwent a magnetic resonance imaging test on Sunday night to determine the source of tightness in his lower back and that the results had not shown any structural damage.To be cautious, the Mets said they would place deGrom on the 10-day injured list on Tuesday, retroactive to Monday, which means the earliest he could pitch again would be May 21 in Miami.The team said in a statement that deGrom’s M.R.I. results had been “clean of any issues.”DeGrom missed a start last week because of what the Mets originally described as discomfort in his right side, and he returned to the mound Sunday after the extra rest. He pitched five innings against the Arizona Diamondbacks, allowed a run, a hit and three walks. But as he threw a few warm-up pitches before the sixth inning, deGrom felt more discomfort.
