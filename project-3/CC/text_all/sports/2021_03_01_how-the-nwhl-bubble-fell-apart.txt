How One Sports Season Fell Apart, Even in a Bubble
The coronavirus infiltrated the National Women’s Hockey League season at the end of January, and players still don’t know how that was allowed to happen.That was the main theme from a dozen players who spoke with The New York Times who saw their season at a so-called bubble environment in Lake Placid, N.Y., cut short after positive tests overwhelmed the league ahead of its semifinals and finals, which were scheduled to be televised nationally.The league could not complete its 2019-20 season because of the pandemic, but it had momentum entering the two weeks of games it planned to hold for its sixth season. It had added a sixth team to the five returning from the previous season, and reached a broadcast agreement with NBC Sports.Since the season was postponed on Feb. 3, with intentions but no announced plans of resuming play, the players, including several dozen who believe they contracted the virus while playing, have returned home.
