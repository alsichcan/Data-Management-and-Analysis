Meyers Leonard Will Be Away From Heat ‘Indefinitely’ After Use of Anti-Semitic Slur
Meyers Leonard, a reserve center for the Miami Heat, will be “away from the team indefinitely,” the team said Tuesday night, following his use of an anti-Semitic slur while he was playing a video game on a public livestream.“The Miami HEAT vehemently condemns the use of any form of hate speech,” the team said in a statement. “The words used by Meyers Leonard were wrong and we will not tolerate hateful language from anyone associated with our franchise. To hear it from a Miami Heat player is especially disappointing and hurtful to all those who work here, as well as the larger South Florida, Miami Heat and N.B.A. communities.”Leonard, 29, was playing “Call Of Duty: Warzone,” a popular multiplayer video game, on Twitch, a livestreaming platform populated mostly by gamers.Leonard said the slur, followed by a sexist vulgarity, after calling another player a “coward” because of how they tried to kill his character in the game. The video was recorded Monday but did not receive widespread attention until Tuesday, after the clip of Leonard uttering the slur was posted to social media. By the afternoon, it was the top trending topic on Twitter in the United States.
