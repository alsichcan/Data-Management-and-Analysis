A Well-Earned Walk: Luis Guillorme Trots to First After 22 Pitches
It was only an exhibition, so nothing from the Mets’ 7-5 victory over the St. Louis Cardinals on Sunday will count as more than an amusing oddity. But the Mets’ Luis Guillorme did something that just might be unprecedented: He saw 22 pitches in a single turn at the plate.The odd event came in the fifth inning in Port St. Lucie, Fla., against the hard-throwing Cardinals reliever Jordan Hicks. Guillorme fell behind on a called strike and a swinging strike. Then, over the course of 20 pitches, he swatted 16 fouls and took four pitches out of the strike zone, earning a satisfying trot to first as teammates roared with laughter.“I’m just happy I ended up with the walk, because if I would have gotten out, that would’ve been not fun for me — all that work for nothing,” Guillorme said. “It’s pretty cool.”
