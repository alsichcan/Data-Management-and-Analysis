A ‘Super’ N.F.L. Playoff Weekend Is Missing Something. Can You Guess What?
The N.F.L. playoffs are one of the biggest sporting obsessions in the United States, typically among the most-watched television programming of the year.And this year the postseason will get an extra boost because the N.F.L. has added two playoff games, for a total of six games over Saturday and Sunday in what the league is calling “Super Wild Card Weekend.”Yet the monthlong postseason party — which includes perennial contenders like the New Orleans Saints and the Seattle Seahawks as well as rarer participants like the Buffalo Bills and the Cleveland Browns — will be drained of some of the color, sound and pomp as the league navigates the coronavirus pandemic.Most games will be played with no or very few fans in the seats, sapping some of the drama — not to mention live crowd noise — from the football festivities. There will be only a few hundred, not thousands of, Terrible Towels waved in Pittsburgh. There weren’t any “12s,” as Seahawks supporters are known, shaking the rafters Saturday in Seattle, because spectators were barred. Just 3,000 Saints fans will be yelling “Who dat?” in the cavernous Superdome.
