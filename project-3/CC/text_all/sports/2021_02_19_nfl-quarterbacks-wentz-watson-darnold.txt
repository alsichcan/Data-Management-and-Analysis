[Editors’ note: This article was updated March 17 with additional news of player signings.]With the arrival of a new league year on March 17, free agent deals can become official and already three quarterbacks — including the first and second picks in the 2016 draft — have been traded. More movement, possibly much more, will follow. Frustrated stars, well-priced veterans, young starters — all could be on the move, as this emerging era of quarterback empowerment collides with a salary-cap crunch that compels teams to assess their resources at the sport's most critical position.Here’s a partial list of quarterbacks who will be — or might be — wearing new uniforms when the 2021 season opens next fall.Jared Goff, Rams to Lions Whether Goff, 26, revitalizes his career with Dan Campbell’s merry band of kneecap biters in Detroit depends, in part, on his aptitude for doing something with the Lions that he did not do with the Rams: hold on to the ball.
