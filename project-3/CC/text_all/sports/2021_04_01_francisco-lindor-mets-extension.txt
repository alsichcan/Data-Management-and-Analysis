‘Here We Go Baby’: Francisco Lindor Truly Commits to the Mets
WASHINGTON — Unable to contain his jubilation, Francisco Lindor unleashed a short celebratory scream in his hotel room late Wednesday when his agent informed him that the Mets had agreed to give him a franchise record 10-year, $341 million contract extension.Shortly after, as Lindor told his father about his brief outburst and suggested he wanted to yell even more, Miguel Lindor urged his son to practice decorum and not to make a racket in the hotel.No chance of that. And the only way Francisco Lindor, 27, could make his father understand how impossible it would have been to remain quiet at such a moment was to make a comparison an average person might be able to grasp.“You know when you drive down the highway and you see a billboard for the Powerball that says $300 million?” Lindor, the Mets’ gifted shortstop, told reporters on a video conference call on Thursday. “Imagine you getting that right now. You are going to tell me you aren’t going to scream? I am going to scream. I want to scream. I’ve been working for years my whole entire life.”
