Tommy Lasorda, a Dodger From His Cleats to His Cap, Dies at 93
Tommy Lasorda, the irrepressible baseball lifer who managed the Los Angeles Dodgers to four National League pennants and two World Series championships in a Hall of Fame career that spanned eight decades of bleeding Dodger blue, died on Thursday in Fullerton, Calif. He was 93 and had been the oldest living member of the Baseball Hall of Fame.His death was announced by the Dodgers in a statement. The team said Lasorda suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest at his home in Fullerton and was pronounced dead after being transported to a nearby hospital.Willie Mays, at 89, is now the oldest living Hall of Famer.Lasorda, a chubby left-handed pitcher, had a brief and forgettable playing career — he threw three wild pitches in the first inning of the only game he started for the Brooklyn Dodgers — but went on to become one of baseball’s marvelous characters.While managing the Dodgers for all or parts of 21 consecutive seasons and working for them into his final years, when he held the title of senior adviser to the team president, he was a perpetual optimist, a compulsive storyteller and, much like Casey Stengel, a celebrity even for people with only a marginal interest in baseball.
