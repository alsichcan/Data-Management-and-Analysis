Paige Bueckers Knows UConn’s History. She’s Paving Its Future.
Burnout doesn’t seem to exist in Paige Bueckers’s world.In a coronavirus-riddled season where student-athletes can do little else on campus besides play their sport, Bueckers, the University of Connecticut freshman, spends her rare free time outside of practice and games immersing herself in, rather than taking a break from, basketball.“As soon as I get off the court I’m watching games as well,” Bueckers said in a phone interview. “I spend a lot of time just watching basketball.”N.B.A., college and even the G League games captivate her. Pandemic or not, that’s how it’s always been for Bueckers (pronounced BECK-ers), the latest in a long line of highly regarded stars to lead the most successful women’s hoops program of our time.While Bueckers devotes her downtime to watching others play, the rest of the basketball world is watching her. A five-star recruit from Minnetonka, Minn., who first received scholarship offers at 14 years old, Bueckers justified the hype over her college career in early February when she scored 30 points in three consecutive games, the first player in UConn’s history to do so. Capping those performances was a 31-point effort to beat then-top-ranked South Carolina in overtime. Bueckers scored the team’s final 13 points, the last of which came on an instantly viral 3-pointer she launched falling away that ricocheted skyward off the rim before dropping in to seal the victory.
