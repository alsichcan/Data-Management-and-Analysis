The Yankees Will Have to Get Creative in Zack Britton’s Absence
The Yankees acquired Zack Britton in a trade with the Baltimore Orioles on July 24, 2018. Two days later, he made his first appearance in pinstripes, and soon became a mainstay in the bullpen and a leading voice in the clubhouse.Over the past two and a half seasons, Britton has logged a 2.14 earned run average over 111 appearances. Only four other qualified relievers in the major leagues have a lower E.R.A. in that span. And on the Yankees, a team that has dealt with numerous injuries over the years, Britton has been their best and most reliable reliever since his arrival.His leadership and his dependability made Tuesday a hard day for the Yankees, as the team announced that Britton, a left-hander, would soon undergo arthroscopic surgery in New York to remove a bone chip from his throwing elbow. Although no timetable was provided for Britton’s return, similar injuries have cost pitchers two or three months.Before Britton, 33, experienced stiffness after a recent bullpen session at the Yankees’ facility in Tampa, Fla. and tests discovered the source, he was already dealing with the aftereffects of another ailment: Covid-19.
