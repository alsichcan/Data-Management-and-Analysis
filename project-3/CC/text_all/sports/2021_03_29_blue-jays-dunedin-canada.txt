O Dunedin: Canada Will Have to Wait to See the Blue Jays
[See photos and follow live coverage from opening day.]It has been 18 months since the Toronto Blue Jays played a game in Canada, and it is likely to be several more before the team can return to its home field at Rogers Centre.So, for now, home for one of the most intriguing teams in the game — one with an enviable combination of young, hungry talent and proven veteran free agent additions — will be a tiny spring training park in Dunedin, Fla. Coronavirus precautions may be easing around the United States, but baseball fans in Canada will simply have to wait.“Obviously, we can’t wait for the day when we will be back in Toronto,” Ross Atkins, the Blue Jays’ general manager, said in a recent interview. “The players understand this is part of going through a pandemic, and as long as they have what they need to prepare, compete and recover, we will be OK. They are excited about this being their home for the short term.”
