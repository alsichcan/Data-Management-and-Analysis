Residents say the crash happened on a dangerous stretch of road.
RANCHO PALOS VERDES, Calif. — The area where Tiger Woods was injured in a wreck on Tuesday is a perilous stretch of road for drivers in Southern California, with steep and winding terrain and a reputation for frequent accidents.“If you get distracted, you can start going fast,” said Farideh Sotoodeh, who has lived in the neighborhood for about 20 years and went near the crash site on Tuesday after she heard a helicopter flying overhead.Others had also gathered near yellow emergency tape. Ryan Alimento, 18, was studying at his parents’ home when he heard an aircraft above. A friend texted him about the crash.“Growing up in Southern California, you hear his name all the time,” Alimento, a student at the University of Southern California, said. “For me, being Asian-American, he was a role model. He has a complicated past, but watching him accomplish all the things he did, I thought maybe I can do big things too.”
