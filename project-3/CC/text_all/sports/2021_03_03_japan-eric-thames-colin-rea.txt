Japan’s Travel Ban Has American Baseball Players in Limbo
As his friends and former teammates work out at major league spring training camps across Florida and Arizona, Colin Rea trudges through the snow of eastern Iowa doing his best to prepare for the season in surroundings that don’t lend themselves to the game.After pitching in nine games for the Chicago Cubs last season, Rea signed with Japan’s Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks over the winter. He fully expected to be training in the warmth of their southern Japan camp when it opened on Feb. 1.Instead, Rea — like more than a dozen other players who joined Japanese clubs in the off-season — is in limbo. Japan closed its borders to noncitizens and new arrivals on Jan. 4 in a heightened effort to control the spread of the coronavirus. Originally in effect through Feb. 7, the current entry ban now extends through March 7, but it is continually being reviewed.Until the border reopens, Rea is preparing the best he can and trying to maintain a sense of humor.“I think high school was the last time I trained with snow on the ground this late in the off-season,” Rea said in a recent telephone interview. “I have access to a weight room and indoor bullpen, so nothing outdoors yet, but it’s supposed to warm up to 30 degrees, so who knows?”
