Australian Open 2021: In Defeat, Jennifer Brady Proves She Belongs
MELBOURNE, Australia — She was playing with house money, a No. 22 seed who spent 15 days confined to a hotel room last month, a former U.C.L.A. Bruin who went to college because she did not have the head for professional tennis at 18 years old and was in need of a backup plan.The old Jennifer Brady was not the one who took the court Saturday night. This Brady approached this match as though she deserved to be here, like she belonged and did not need a participation medal for making it to her first Grand Slam final. Brady took the court believing she could go toe-to-toe with Naomi Osaka, the three-time (make that four-time) Grand Slam champion and the best player in the world right now.Brady had done just that in the semifinals at the United States Open in September, pushing Osaka to three sets and forcing her to come up with everything she had. This was the second Grand Slam in six months where Brady was playing in the final three matches.Brady, 25, predicted she would be nervous at the start of the match, and she was, because she was trying to make something big happen and not just play a supporting role in Osaka’s coronation. She fiddled with her skirt as it blew in the evening breeze. She struggled to find a rhythm while serving. She would land just 48 percent of her first serves.
