His mother, however, said no. She wanted him to finish high school, which many boys on the baseball-mad Caribbean island forsake to chase their dreams and earn life-changing money for their families. Jiménez yearned to do the same.But after securing his high school diploma a year later, Jiménez was met with another condition from his mother. Before she allowed him to sign with the Colorado Rockies, she asked for a promise that one day, when the time was right, he would return to his studies so he could eventually become a professional in a field beyond baseball.“I never forgot it,” he said in Spanish by phone this week. “And she didn’t let me forget it.”All these years later — after 12 major league seasons, a World Series appearance, a no-hitter and more than $65 million in career earnings — Jiménez, 37, kept his word and accomplished something rare among professional baseball players: He received a college degree. On Saturday, he graduated — virtually, of course — magna cum laude from the Florida Institute of Technology with a bachelor’s degree in business administration and management.
