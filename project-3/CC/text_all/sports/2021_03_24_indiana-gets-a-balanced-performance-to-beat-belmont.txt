Indiana gets a balanced performance to beat Belmont.
Fourth-seeded Indiana has punched its first-ever ticket to the Sweet 16 with a 70-48 blowout win over No. 12 seed Belmont, keeping the Bruins from an upset run. It is Hoosiers Coach Teri Moren’s first trip to the round of 16.Four of five starters scored at least 10 points each for the Hoosiers. The fifth, 6-foot-3 junior Aleksa Gulbe, had 9 points and 15 rebounds.“A lot of the things she does don’t show up on the stat sheet,” said Grace Berger, who had 17 points in the game and has the most triple-doubles in Division I this season. “To see her get 15 rebounds is big time, but it’s nothing she doesn’t do for us every game.”Belmont was able to stay within range through the first half, but Indiana pulled away and had the Bruins in foul trouble in the second half. While the Hoosiers made 14 free throws, Belmont was able to make just one, preventing the Bruins from staying competitive.
