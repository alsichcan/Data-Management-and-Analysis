There Is a Reason All the No. 1 Women’s Seeds Played on Tuesday
SAN ANTONIO — Basketball fans have had an unusual chance this week to binge-watch all four top seeds in an N.C.A.A. tournament within hours of one another. Generally, that would be possible only if each team reached the Final Four, when the session would be limited to two games.But for the women’s tournament this year, the top seeds were deliberately lined up to play on the same day in the earlier rounds. The N.C.A.A. and ESPN, which has exclusive television rights to the tournament along with its sister station ABC, wanted it that way particularly for the second round on Tuesday, when the men’s tournament would be idle. The scheduling move created a chance to showcase the favored teams.
