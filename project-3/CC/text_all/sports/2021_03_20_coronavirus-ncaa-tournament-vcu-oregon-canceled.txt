N.C.A.A.’s Fear of a Canceled Tournament Game Arrives
INDIANAPOLIS — It was a Faustian bargain that college basketball made last autumn when it plowed ahead with a season into the headwinds of the coronavirus pandemic. There would be games, college sports administrators declared, because there needed to be a path to the N.C.A.A. men’s tournament, which the governing body could ill afford to have canceled for the second year in a row.But there would also be positive tests, pauses from play, and schedules reconstructed on the fly. Isolation and anxiety were part of the compact for four months.The calculus, though, is different now.A positive test won’t just pause a season; it can end it.That cold reality found a victim on Saturday night when Virginia Commonwealth, the 10th-seeded team in the West region, stunningly dropped out of the tournament just more than three hours before it was scheduled to tip off against Oregon because it had received “multiple positive tests” over the last 48 hours, the school said.The N.C.A.A.’s coronavirus standards dictate that teams can play with at least five players who are not held out by either a positive test or contact tracing. V.C.U.’s athletic director, Ed McLaughlin, said the Rams had enough players, but that health officials in Marion County, which includes Indianapolis, were concerned about the spate of positive tests in recent days. Since the 68-team tournament bracket was locked on Tuesday night, V.C.U.’s departure — which necessitated a no-contest — meant that Oregon, the seventh seed in the West Region, advanced to the second round.
