Opting In: The Padres Truly Commit to Fernando Tatis Jr.
In A.J. Preller’s first off-season as the San Diego Padres’ general manager, after the 2014 season, he did what players and fans always want: he went for it. The Padres had become baseball’s most anonymous franchise, so Preller tried to prop them up by trading prospects for veterans and signing the right-handed starter James Shields as a free agent.It didn’t work. When the 2015 Padres actually got worse, Preller reversed course and spent the next four years building the farm system, often by trading veterans for lottery tickets. One such deal sent Shields to the Chicago White Sox for a 16-year-old shortstop with a major league pedigree who had not yet played a professional game. The player was Fernando Tatis Jr.On Wednesday night, the Padres agreed to terms with Tatis on a $340 million contract. The deal was confirmed by a person with direct knowledge of it who was granted anonymity because the team has not officially announced it. At 14 years, it is the longest contract in major league history, and the third richest.Nobody knew that Tatis, 22, would be this good. He has already accumulated more wins above replacement than his father, who played 11 seasons in the majors. In 143 games across two seasons, Tatis has hit .301 with 39 homers, 98 runs batted in, 27 stolen bases and accumulated a .956 on-base plus slugging percentage.
