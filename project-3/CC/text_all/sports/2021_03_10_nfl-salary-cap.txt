N.F.L. Salary Cap Drops to $182.5 Million for 2021
The N.F.L. has determined the salary cap for the 2021 season, saying each team will have $182.5 million to spend on player payroll, nearly 8 percent less than in 2020, when revenues were cleaved by the coronavirus pandemic. In 2020, the salary cap was $198.2 million, a league record.A decline in the cap, the maximum amount available for teams to spend on player salaries and bonuses, was expected, but it was less severe than anticipated. Still, N.F.L. franchises will have nearly $16 million less than they had last year to pay players, which is sure to distort how general managers allocate their more limited funds.Sports Business Journal was first to report the final salary cap figure, which fell for only the second time since the spending limit was introduced in 1994.With the free-agent market loaded with big-name quarterbacks and other star players looking to relocate, teams seeking to sign those players will have less money left to fill out their rosters. That could lead general managers to sign more rookies and free agents who are willing to play for league-minimum salaries or to sign the biggest names to one-year deals, rather than look to veterans seeking lucrative long-term contracts.
