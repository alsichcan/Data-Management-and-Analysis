Francisco Lindor Talks Mets, Pizza and Contract Extensions
Francisco Lindor was caught in an awkward position on Monday: eager to show enthusiasm about joining a new team while not forgetting about the one he left behind.Lindor, a superstar shortstop, spent nine years growing and developing in Cleveland’s organizational family. He took time to express love for that city and its fans. He had always expected that team to wrap him in the cloak of a long-term contract, never letting him go.But after Cleveland concluded that it would not meet Lindor’s expectations for a contract extension, it sent him to the Mets in last week’s blockbuster trade.Lindor enjoyed his time in Cleveland, but during a video conference call on Monday he could barely contain his glee about joining a team building toward something big, with him right at the center.
