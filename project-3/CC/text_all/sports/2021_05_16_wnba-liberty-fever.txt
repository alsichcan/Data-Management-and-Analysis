The Liberty Get Another Shot at a Fresh Start
They weren’t supposed to meet this way, the new-look Liberty and their fans in sea foam green. The chants for Sabrina Ionescu, the 2020 No. 1 overall pick, were supposed to have echoed in Barclays Center last spring. She was supposed to rain down 3-pointers, and the Liberty were, fans believed, going to rack up wins.But as with so much last year, things weren’t as they were supposed to be. The coronavirus pandemic delayed the W.N.B.A. season, Ionescu missed all but three games with an ankle injury, and the Liberty won just two games in a fan-less bubble environment in Florida.Yet Liberty fans are now getting the introduction they wanted then, even as markers of the past year of turmoil — in basketball and beyond — remain.
