With Another Olympic Chance in View, Nathan Chen Dominates on the Ice
The transformative moment of Nathan Chenâ€™s figure-skating career came barely 24 hours after its greatest disappointment.At the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea, where he was a favorite to win gold, Chen skated a disastrous short program that left him in 17th place halfway through the competition. Knowing he was out of contention for a medal, Chen delivered a stunning performance the next day, landing six quadruple jumps as he won the long program and finished fifth over all.Since that day 35 months ago, Chen, 21, has won every competition he has entered, claiming two world championships and three national titles, including his fifth straight on Sunday in Las Vegas.No American man had won that many consecutive national championships since Dick Button, a two-time Olympic champion, claimed seven in a row from 1946 to 1952.
