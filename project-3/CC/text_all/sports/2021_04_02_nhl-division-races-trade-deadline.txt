With New Wrinkle, N.H.L. Division Races Heat Up
There’s a lot that is different about the N.H.L. schedule this season.Start with the compressed timeline, requiring 868 regular-season games to be played in 119 days. Then there are the numerous Covid-19 protocols and restrictions, with more added since the season started. And due to the postponements and shutdowns, schedules have been in near-constant flux, wreaking havoc on practices and planning.Yet there’s widespread agreement that this season’s scheduling format, which mostly features two-game series in the same city with a day off in between, and the geography-driven divisional alignment, has enlivened what typically is a grueling slog to the Stanley Cup playoffs.“If you could put fans in the building,” Winnipeg Coach Paul Maurice said, “I would love for it to be like this forever.”As teams approach the final 20 games of the regular season, and races to gain playoff position by finishing in the top four of each division intensify, this year’s schedule provides another bonus. The exclusively intradivisional play makes each contest a four-point game and provides the potential for quick climbs or slides in the standings.
