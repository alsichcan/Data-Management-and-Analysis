Three Judges Endorsed Penalties for Russia’s Doping. Then They Cut the Ban in Half.
In page after page, the report amounts to one of the starkest denunciations yet of Russia’s efforts to evade antidoping rules.Compiled by a panel of three arbitrators at the Court of Arbitration for Sport, and meant to be the final word on Russia’s yearslong doping scheme, the report leaves little doubt about the scale of the state-orchestrated campaign. It outlines how sports and government officials in Russia attempted to deceive the global antidoping regulator in a manner that “could hardly be more serious.” It details how, when caught, the Russians tried to cover up the scheme. When those actions were discovered, too, the report says, Russia tried to cover up the cover-up.The authors of the report — which has not been released but has been reviewed by The New York Times — resolved to take action. Serious action. Without it, they warned, “the clear message will be that governments and public authorities can corrupt and manipulate antidoping programs.”
