Tom Wilson Is Hockey’s Chief Villain. Or Is He?
Washington Capitals forward Tom Wilson, according to some of his peers, is a menace. A bully. A punk. A goon. He is reckless, vicious, dirty, and bad for hockey. He might have fit in 30 years ago, but his conduct — illegal checks and high hits, at the price of five suspensions in his career — has no place in today’s safety-conscious N.H.L.Tom Wilson, according to others, is a really good dude. A leader. A unifying force. An excellent teammate. He is thoughtful, conscientious, attentive, and great in the Capitals’ locker room. He would have fit in 30 years ago, but his style — brawny and physical, with top-six skill and speed — is all the more coveted now as the league’s players trend toward smaller and faster.In a brutal sport full of paradoxes, no one tilts toward the extreme more than Wilson, a 6-foot-4, 225-pound pile of dynamite whose antics (or efforts) seem to elicit rage (or respect) darn near every game. His latest misadventure, a post-whistle scrum with two Rangers on May 3, earned him 14 of his league-leading 96 penalty minutes this season, a maximum $5,000 fine from the department of player safety and indignation across hockey’s empire over another incident that reinforced his standing as the N.H.L.’s chief villain. He also had a goal and an assist that night, as he surged toward the most points per game of his career (0.70).
