The Major League Baseball Players’ Association recently filed a grievance over the shortened 2020 season, as they had threatened to do since negotiations with the league soured last summer.In turn, M.L.B. filed a countergrievance, and it has asked a three-person arbitration panel to expedite the process, according to a person familiar with the situation who was not authorized to speak publicly about a sensitive matter.The filing of the grievance and the amount sought — an estimated $500 million in damages — were first reported by The New York Post on Thursday. The union confirmed the filing but declined to comment further.The grievance will go before a three-person arbitration panel, for which each side appoints one member while the third is mutually agreed upon.
