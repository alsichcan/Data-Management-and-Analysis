U.C.L.A. Is Trying to Send Gonzaga Back to ‘Heartbreak City’
Ryan Hollins wanted to share a message for his U.C.L.A. Bruins on the eve of their Final Four matchup against Gonzaga.“Because of what we did and the success that we had, Mark Few is going to try and put those boys in the dirt,” Hollins said. “They better have their hard hats ready, because they’ve inherited a rivalry that they don’t even know they’re stepping into, to be honest.”Hollins played center on the U.C.L.A. team that engineered one of the most remarkable N.C.A.A. men’s tournament comebacks in the last generation. In 2006, U.C.L.A. frantically and improbably erased a 17-point deficit against Gonzaga in the regional semifinals, a rally that ended Adam Morrison’s storied college career.In the aftermath of the game, Darren Collison, then a U.C.L.A. guard, said he had no words to describe what had happened. That sentiment rings true 15 years later. “I’m still speechless to this day,” Collison said Thursday. “That whole entire game, things weren’t going well for us for up until the last five or so minutes.”
