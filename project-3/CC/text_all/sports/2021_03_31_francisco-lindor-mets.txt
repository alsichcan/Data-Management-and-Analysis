Hernandez and Strawberry. Reyes and Wright. Lindor?
In six seasons with Cleveland, Francisco Lindor showcased a multifaceted set of skills that, packaged underneath an irrepressible passion and an enchanting smile, combined to make him one of the most exciting, charismatic and winning players in baseball.Beginning Thursday, Lindor will put that total package on display for the Mets, with a chance to do something even more profound. Given his age, talent and apparent dedication to the sport, and provided he eventually signs with the club long term, Lindor, 27, has a chance to become the best all-around position player the Mets have ever had.“He could exceed them all,” said Bobby Valentine, who since 1977 has played, coached, managed and been a television analyst for the Mets. “His toolbox has the best set of tools, I think, of anyone who has ever played for the Mets.”[See photos and follow live coverage from opening day.]Mike Piazza hit the ball farther and had a better batting average, but was not a top-notch defender or runner. Carlos Beltran was the best free-agent signing in franchise history, but he broke down some after his first four years with the team. Darryl Strawberry hit the ball to the moon, and had the speed to steal bases, but he was less consistent at the plate and could not match Lindor’s defense.
