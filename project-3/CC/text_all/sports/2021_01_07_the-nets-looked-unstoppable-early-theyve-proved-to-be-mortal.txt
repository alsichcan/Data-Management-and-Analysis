The Nets Looked Unstoppable Early. They’ve Proved to Be Mortal.
Raise your hand if you thought the Knicks would have a better record than the Nets through the first 10 percent of the season.We’ll wait.Just one: James L. Dolan? OK, then.The Nets are 4-4, which isn’t a disaster but does reflect an uneven start. They looked unstoppable in the preseason, and then opened the regular season with dominant wins over the Golden State Warriors and the Boston Celtics. Since then they’ve lost four out of six and have looked quite mortal.One of the losses was against the Memphis Grizzlies in overtime when the Nets sat their two best players, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant. Another came against the Washington Wizards when both Irving and Durant missed quality looks at the end of the game. The team could just as easily be 6-2.But it’s not. And while it is still early, the Nets have less time than usual to collect themselves because the season is 72 games rather than the usual 82. It’s also unclear when Durant, who missed Tuesday’s win against Utah because of Covid-19 health and safety protocols that will keep him out for at least seven days, will be back in the lineup. The team has not specified which aspect of the protocols prompted Durant to be held out of the game.
