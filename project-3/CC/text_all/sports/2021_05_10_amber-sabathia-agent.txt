After Years in a Supporting Role, Amber Sabathia Is in Charge
C.C. Sabathia has often joked that once he announced his retirement from the Yankees, he stepped aside and let his wife, Amber, get to work.Throughout his career, she had: Running their family of four children, guiding him through the highs (an American League Cy Young Award and a World Series title) and the lows (alcoholism and injuries), and counseling him through contract negotiations. Particularly in 2019, the last of his 19 major-league seasons, she served as an executive producer of a documentary about his life, and organized his farewell tour.“C.C. said, ‘You know, you would make a great agent,’” Amber Sabathia said in a phone interview. “And we laughed about it and he said, ‘No, seriously, you’ve been my agent the past seven years.’”With experience amassed from over two decades inside the baseball industry as an adviser, philanthropist, marketer, wife and mother, Sabathia formalized that step last week when Creative Artists Agency announced that it hired her as an agent. She has already passed a background check through the Major League Baseball Players Association and can begin operating as an agent as she prepares for a test in September that will finalize her ability to represent a player on a major-league roster.
