Lake Tahoe’s Sunshine Made for a Great Scene, but Bad Ice
STATELINE, Nev. — The N.H.L. set out for a grand outdoor spectacle at Lake Tahoe. But after one period of Saturday’s game between the Colorado Avalanche and the Vegas Golden Knights, the venture became a bid for longest intermission: The remainder of the game had to be played under lights instead of in daylight, and it spilled into Sunday in much of North America.The idea behind N.H.L. Outdoors, two regular-season games on a rink at the 18th hole of a golf course and without fans, was to create a picturesque precedent for national television, with a splendorous blend of snow, sun, water, mountains and trees as an organic backdrop.Instead, the deciding moments of the game unfolded after midnight Eastern time after the game was postponed because of excessive sunlight and poor ice conditions. The delay was 8 hours 8 minutes, and the game ended at 1:50 a.m. Eastern time, more than 10½ hours after it began.“We’ve done over 30 games, and we’ve never had a problem quite like this,” Gary Bettman, the N.H.L. commissioner, said. “We’ve played in some rain, we’ve played in snow, but sunshine has always been our enemy.”
