Michigan Leads East After Falling Short in Big Ten Tournament
When Michigan hired Juwan Howard, one of the stars of its “Fab Five” team from the early ’90s who went on to a long N.B.A. career, as its coach in May 2019, he didn’t have head coaching experience on his résumé.At the time, it was fair to wonder how Howard’s background as an assistant coach with the Miami Heat from 2013 to 2019 would translate when he ran his own program in the Big Ten Conference — one of the most competitive in the nation.After all, the former N.B.A. players Chris Mullin (St. John’s), Mike Dunleavy (Tulane) and Avery Johnson (Alabama) had all been fired from or quit their coaching jobs that off-season. Mullin and Clyde Drexler, a former University of Houston star and coach, both struggled at their alma maters. The Georgetown legend Patrick Ewing is hovering around .500 as the head coach of his alma mater, but earned his first N.C.A.A. tournament appearance with a win over Creighton in the Big East tournament championship game on Saturday.In his second season, Howard has guided the Wolverines to their first No. 1 seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament since 1993, when he played with Jimmy King, Jalen Rose, Chris Webber and Ray Jackson on a team that reached back-to-back N.C.A.A. championship games.
