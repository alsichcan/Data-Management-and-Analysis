How Blowing Up College Sports Became a Rallying Cry for Some in Washington
Ramogi Huma, a former college football player, had been at a Justice Department lectern for eight seconds when he began an excoriation of the National Collegiate Athletic Association.The governing body of college sports was, he declared, “a predatory economic cartel that treats players like university property rather than people.”Huma had long used similar language as the leader of the National College Players Association, an advocacy group. But his 2019 speech to a roomful of antitrust experts at the Robert F. Kennedy Building signaled a shift in Washington. Less than a decade earlier, Huma recalled, federal law enforcement officials had told him that the capital’s political climate did not support action against the N.C.A.A. Now he was being invited to speak on Pennsylvania Avenue.“More and more people find what the N.C.A.A. is doing is just patently unacceptable in terms of their treatment of athletes,” said Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, who played football at Stanford University and has championed a proposal that would compel colleges to share athletics profits with some players. The association, he added, was “not realizing the moral view of this has really grown or shifted.”
