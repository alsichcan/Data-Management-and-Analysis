James Harden Could Be Out Until the Playoffs
After a setback for the star guard James Harden in his recovery from a hamstring injury, Nets Coach Steve Nash made the painful admission on Tuesday night that Harden might be sidelined until the start of the N.B.A. postseason next month.The Nets have had a healthy Harden, Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving all on the court for just 186 minutes this season across seven games since acquiring Harden from the Houston Rockets in a Jan. 14 trade. Even if Harden can come back before the Nets complete their 14 remaining regular-season games, they will be chasing the first championship in the franchise’s N.B.A. history with less on-court time together for their three stars than any team of recent vintage regarded a title contender.“He’ll be back when he’s back,” Nash said. “That may not be until the playoffs. It may be sooner. I don’t know.”Harden is one of the N.B.A.’s most durable players and played some of the best all-around basketball of his career in his first three months as a Net before missing the Nets’ first two games in April with a strained right hamstring. He has missed nine of the Nets’ last 10 games; missing seven games with Houston during the 2017-18 season was the previous longest absence of Harden’s career. Before their 134-129 victory on Tuesday night in New Orleans, the Nets announced that Harden had suffered a setback during an off-court rehabilitation session on Monday that will keep him out indefinitely.
