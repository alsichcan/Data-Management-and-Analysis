Baylor Is the Top Seed in a Region of Heavyweights
In spite of a loss to Oklahoma State on Friday night, Baylor could find itself in a fight for the title as it leans on three starting guards: Jared Butler, MaCio Teague and Davion Mitchell.Baylor had the best start in program history, with 18 consecutive victories, and won the Big 12 regular-season title for the first time. The last time the Bears clinched a conference title was in 1950 as a co-champion and in 1948 as the outright winner. Baylor’s proficiency — it led the league in 3-point shooting this season — could help reverse its struggles of late.The team has lost just two of its 24 games this season, but dealt with a long recovery from the three weeks it spent on pause in February because of coronavirus protocols. In the Bears’ first game back, they barely beat Iowa State, which ranked 10th in the Big 12, and they absorbed their first loss in the next game, against Kansas.Similar issues surfaced during the Big 12 tournament. Baylor made a season-high 21 turnovers in a win against Kansas State on Thursday, then lost after a back-and-forth second half against Oklahoma State on Friday, 83-74, failing to reach the tournament’s title game.
