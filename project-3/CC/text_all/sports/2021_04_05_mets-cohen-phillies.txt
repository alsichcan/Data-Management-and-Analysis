Steven Cohen Sets High Expectations for the Mets. Very High.
No one yet knows what kind of baseball team owner Steven Cohen will be once games have been played and performances can be measured along with wins and losses.In Cohen’s first off-season at the helm, Mets fans have gotten a taste that their new owner, when properly motivated, can spend like George Steinbrenner. But will a bombastic and impatient side suddenly appear at the first sign of a losing streak? Or will he demonstrate a hands-off patience, the way Nelson Doubleday once did as the Mets’ owner?It will take time to learn Cohen’s in-season tendencies, a process that began on Monday night in Philadelphia, where the game played by a familiar script from previous seasons. A solid start by Jacob deGrom had the Mets staked to a lead through seven innings, only for the bullpen to collapse late in a 5-3 loss.Just hours before the first pitch on Monday, Cohen made clear that his expectations were high: As in, championships, plural.
