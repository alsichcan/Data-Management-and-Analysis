Celtics Try to Reset Their Championship Aspirations
BOSTON — At the start of the week, Brad Stevens, the coach of the Boston Celtics, mentioned how his players needed to “accomplish some difficult things.”It was a novel way of looking at a potential reset for his team, just before the N.B.A. All-Star break this weekend. Of course, when it comes to muddling through this bizarre, pandemic-stricken season, the Celtics have had plenty of company. Few teams have excelled. But the Celtics were among a select group that showed up for the delayed start of the league calendar in late December with championship aspirations, and they have been among another select few that have — so far, at least — underachieved.Fresh opportunities to accomplish some of those difficult things continue to present themselves, though, and the Celtics are beginning to put the pieces together. On Tuesday night, with a 117-112 victory over the visiting Los Angeles Clippers, the Celtics managed to do something that they had not done since the middle of January: win a third straight game.
