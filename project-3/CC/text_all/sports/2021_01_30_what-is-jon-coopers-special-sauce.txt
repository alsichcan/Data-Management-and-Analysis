What Is Jon Cooper’s ‘Special Sauce’?
After blowing a late-game lead and losing, the Green Bay Gamblers hockey players received a simple order from their coach, a former lawyer named Jon Cooper: For their next practice back home, meet at a local park early in the morning.When they arrived, the only trace of Cooper was a note, left under a puck in the middle of a football field.“This is what it feels like when we show up to every game and you guys don’t!” it read. “Figure it out!”“That completely flipped our season,” said Pat McCadden, the captain of that 2009-10 Gamblers team. Their season ended with a Clark Cup, the championship of the United States Hockey League, the country’s top junior league.
