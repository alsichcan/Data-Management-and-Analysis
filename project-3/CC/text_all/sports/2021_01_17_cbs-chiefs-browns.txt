A CBS outage temporarily left some East Coast football fans in the dark.
A CBS broadcast of the N.F.L. playoff game between the Cleveland Browns and Kansas City Chiefs was briefly cut off for viewers in New York and some other areas on the East Coast on Sunday, prompting complaints and confusion among viewers and a scramble to find other ways to watch the game.The outage began about 20 minutes before the scheduled kickoff at 3:05 p.m. Eastern time, during the network’s pregame show as a segment with the analyst Bill Cowher interviewing Browns Coach Kevin Stefanski was nearing an end. Some viewers saw blank screens while others were not able to tune to the channel or saw error messages indicating CBS was unavailable.The outage lasted about 30 minutes, returning just after Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes ran in the game’s first touchdown and Harrison Butker missed an extra point attempt (that’s why the score was 6-0, in case you missed it).
