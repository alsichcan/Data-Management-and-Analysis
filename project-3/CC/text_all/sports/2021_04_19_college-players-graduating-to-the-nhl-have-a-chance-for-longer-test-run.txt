College Players Graduating to the N.H.L. Have a Chance for Longer Test Run
Each spring as college hockey seasons conclude, several top players — highly drafted underclassmen and free agents, for the most part — quickly progress to the professional ranks. But there’s a bonus for those players this year.Because the N.H.L. season didn’t start until January, and it has been extended to May 19 to accommodate games postponed and rescheduled because of the coronavirus pandemic, college signees will arrive with more games left in the N.H.L. regular season than usual, giving them six additional weeks to acclimate themselves to the pro game. With more games to evaluate players, burning the first year of an entry-level contract becomes less fraught for teams.Some players are initially assigned to American Hockey League affiliates, depending on whether their N.H.L. team is in rebuilding mode with plentiful ice time available for players with promise or chasing a playoff spot.Another complicating factor this year was that the N.H.L. trade deadline, normally in late February, was pushed back to April 12. Trade acquisitions have affected ice time — positively and negatively — for recent collegians.
