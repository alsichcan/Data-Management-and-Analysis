Nets’ Harden Will Miss at Least 10 Days
The injured Nets star Kevin Durant has been missing since mid-February, but his team got some good news on Monday with the return of James Harden, who had missed Brooklyn’s last two games with a hamstring injury.Harden’s return lasted four minutes.When the injury flared up again, he asked to come out. That left the Nets in a serious bind against the Knicks at Barclays Center, their Big Three reduced to a lonely one.Step forward, Kyrie Irving. The third member of the Nets’ star triumvirate poured in 40 points with a blend of speed, strength and deep 3-pointers, as the Nets — short-handed as they have been for much of the season — beat the Knicks, 114-112.The team may be short at least one star for a while longer: While Durant (left hamstring strain) was listed as probably for Wednesday’s game, the Nets said Tuesday afternoon that Harden had undergone a magnetic resonance imaging exam that revealed a right hamstring strain. His status will be re-evaluated in about 10 days, the team said, but for now he will take Durant’s seat on the bench.
