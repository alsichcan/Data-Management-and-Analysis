What to Watch in the N.C.A.A. Men’s Tournament This Weekend
The N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament resumes this weekend with a this-year-only scheduling change: the round of 16 games will be played on Saturday and Sunday this time, with the Final Four spots to be decided on Monday and Tuesday.Here’s what to watch for this weekend:Gonzaga, Baylor and Michigan all avoided the fate of Illinois, which was knocked off by Loyola-Chicago in the second round. And recent history and the betting odds favor one of those programs to cut down the nets after the final on April 5: After all, 10 of the last 13 champions were No. 1 seeds.But who has the toughest road to the Final Four now?Undefeated Gonzaga (28-0) is the clear tournament favorite. It will play Creighton and, if it wins, the Oregon-Southern Cal winner. Both of those games figure to be high-scoring, especially if Oregon advances. But with three finalists for the national player of the year award in Corey Kispert, Drew Timme and the freshman Jalen Suggs, and a fourth player, Joel Ayayi, who has the only triple-double in program history, Gonzaga will be the favorite regardless of who it faces from here on.
