A Derby Winner’s Drug Test Won’t Affect Any Bets. Here’s Why.
So now that the Kentucky Derby winner Medina Spirit has failed a drug test, I can cash my bet on the second-place finisher, Mandaloun. And my buddy who bet Medina Spirit will have to return his winnings, right?Well, no.Betting rules at horse racing tracks, off-site wagering venues and internet sites are very clear in cases like this. Once a race has been declared official, a few minutes after it is over, the betting is final. Winners can collect their cash, and losers can tear up their tickets.The reason for this is pretty simple. Once the money starts getting handed over, it becomes impossible to track. Derby bettors have long since folded up their cash, or maybe spent it on a round of drinks. And who’s going to be the person tasked with walking up to Lefty or Cincinnati Joe and asking him to give back that $20 he just pocketed?This statute of limitations applies to other kinds of sports wagering. When Reggie Bush returned his 2005 Heisman Trophy five years later in the wake of a recruiting scandal, none of those who bet on him to win it had to return their profits. Entire teams can be stripped of their moments of triumph. Bettors cannot.
