Trainer Barred in New York and Other States for Giving Horse a Racist Name
The New York Racing Association on Saturday barred a prominent trainer from competitions on its circuit for changing the name of one of his horses to a racial slur and taunting a Black analyst for the horse racing network TVG.The trainer, Eric Guillot, can no longer enter horses or have stalls on the nation’s premier circuit. Horses he trained have earned more than $13 million in purses and have won 259 races, including the Whitney, Test and Jim Dandy Stakes, all considered among New York’s most important races.“Racism is completely unacceptable in all forms,” David O’Rourke, the association’s president and chief executive, said in a statement. “NYRA rejects Eric Guillot’s toxic words and divisive behavior in the strongest terms.”He added, “Our racing community is diverse, and we stand for inclusion.”The Stronach Group, which owns racetracks in Maryland, Florida and California, also said Saturday that it would not allow horses trained by Guillot to race at its tracks.
