With Use of Only One Arm, a Snowboarder Speeds to Success
When Kiana Clay rides a chairlift, she always sits on the left side of the seat so she can use her one functioning arm to push off at the top. Once there, she steps onto her snowboard, points down the mountain and picks up speed.A lot of it.She has racked up several top finishes as she aims to compete in the 2022 Paralympics in Beijing and recently became the first para snowboarder to be signed by the Burton Team, one of the best-known in snowboarding and whose members have included Olympians like Kelly Clark, Chloe Kim and Shaun White.“What struck me with Kiana right away is that she saw how her work might benefit others,” said Donna Carpenter, owner of the Burton snowboarding company, which sponsors the team. “She’s got that single-minded determination, the eye of the tiger that you can recognize in a good athlete.’’Carpenter first learned of Clay when she spoke at a national sportswomen conference a few years ago and was captivated.
