Will More Humanities Benefit Future Doctors?
To the Editor:Re “A Dose of the Humanities,” by Molly Worthen (Sunday Review, April 11):Having recently retired after over 40 years in medical practice, I disagree with Dr. Worthen’s view that medical students need more education in the humanities. In my experience, medical (and nursing) students tend to be among the kindest, most empathetic and most understanding people in any medical center.The real problem comes years later: How do you keep “the system” (billing, charting, documenting, federal and state regulations, hospital committees, credentialing, malpractice, recertification, etc.) from beating it out of them?Allan BernsteinRochester, N.Y.To the Editor:Molly Worthen is right on. As a teacher of medical students and undergraduates who aspire to go to medical school, I cannot count the number of times that students told me they wanted to become physicians because they loved science, and then, as first-year students, were surprised to learn that medicine is not science.Before long they may discover the beauty of the “art of medicine” and the value of a broad education and experience for holistic healing of their patients, especially those who are “off the curve.” It helps negotiate the curves in life outside the white coat, too.
