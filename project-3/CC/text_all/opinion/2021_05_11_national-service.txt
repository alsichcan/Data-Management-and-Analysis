Require a Year of National Service?
To the Editor:Re “A Call to National Service” (editorial, May 2):What better way to build community and the economy than for every 18-year-old to know that on attaining the age of majority or graduating from high school he or she or they will be expected to enroll in a nationwide service program? Unlike the military draft registration, however, the enrollees could make ranked choices among the various options, serving in the military or in the environment, infrastructure, education, child care or health care fields.It should be two years of service, not one. The first year could be primarily training; the second, actual service. Deferments could be available for students enrolled in accredited schools or training programs but, on completion, the graduate would be required to participate for two years in the service area. Exemptions would be available for disabled persons, and for those participating in a similar certified faith-based or charitable program.A national service program is so crucial to our sense of community that Congress should create a new cabinet-level position, the Department of American Service.Elizabeth Pollina DonlonFloral Park, N.Y.To the Editor:What a great idea! Many entering college freshmen (I was one of them once) lack the maturity and perspective to fully profit from their college experience. A year in “the real world” could certainly help them realize that higher education is an opportunity for self-improvement rather than a party.
