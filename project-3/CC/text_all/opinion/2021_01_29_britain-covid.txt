Britain’s National Health Service: How We’re Fighting Covid
To the Editor:Re “U.K. Hospitals Struggle to Cope With New Variant” (news article, Jan. 22):You are wrong about Britain’s National Health Service and our response to Covid-19. To suggest that the pressures of this wave are a peculiarly British issue ignores that the Netherlands is having to transfer patients across the country, Belgian patients have had non-urgent surgery canceled and Spanish hotel beds are being used for patients.As Prime Minister Boris Johnson observed, the new virus variant explained why the N.H.S. “is under such intense pressure.”To prepare for additional coronavirus patients, the N.H.S. delivered a 50 percent increase in critical care beds. Frontline clinicians and other staff members have cared for more than 300,000 patients with Covid, and contrary to your suggestion, the number of N.H.S. staff is up, by 50,000.We also supported research that identified the first effective Covid-19 treatment, dexamethasone, now used worldwide, and administered the world’s first Covid-19 vaccination.
