My Grandfather Was a Good Cop. Or Was He?
When my son crawls into my closet, he finds my grandfather’s police star. He flips open the heavy leather billfold. Etched into gold metal are the words “Chief, Stickney, Illinois.” When he moves onto another toy, I lift the suede protecting the star and slide out the ID card. There’s my grandfather’s signature, his cursive E, blue ink that still looks wet: Edward — a name I’ve passed on to my son.I grew up proud of my grandfather. In a world of adults who vanished into dull, anonymous offices, my grandfather was someone. See the pictures? His starched collar, his pins, his boots; his trooper’s hat, his squad car. Always in uniform. My mother told me he’d wired the police radio into his Oldsmobile.Now, as the horrible images of the Capitol attack proliferate, my grandfather is wired into my vision. I see him in the police beaten by rioters, in the troops pulled out of formation by the mob, in the more than 50 officers who suffered injuries, in the Capitol Police officer who died from his injuries that day and the one who died soon after by suicide. I see him in the faces of the two members of the Rocky Mount Police Department in Virginia who came to the riot, broke into the Capitol, then posed for a photograph they later shared on social media. And I am reminded of my complicated feelings toward him again and again.Stickney people knew him. For most of four decades, his name evoked law and order, generosity and service. At church, parishioners would come over to greet him and my grandmother. The same thing happened at Moldau, a local Bohemian restaurant, where he went to eat pork, dumplings and sauerkraut. When my brother was 4, he dressed as a policeman for Halloween, wielding my grandfather’s billy club.
