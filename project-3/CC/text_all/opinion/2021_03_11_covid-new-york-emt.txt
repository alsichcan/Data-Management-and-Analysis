I Was an E.M.T. in New York Last Spring
One of my most vivid memories from last April is the sound. I was working as an emergency medical technician in New York City. Day and night for weeks, sirens drowned out every other sound within earshot. A doctor told me, “The sound of sirens will be how we all remember this for the rest of our lives.”But will it? What is our capacity as a nation to remember? To hold and bear and suffer this much continuous loss?In those fatal spring months in New York, the sound inside ambulances conveyed, at least to me, a desperateness even more dire than the wailing sirens ricocheting across the city. The radio spat out emergencies nonstop as 911 calls surged beyond the volume on the day of the Sept. 11 attacks. Dispatchers sent E.M.T.s and medics on back-to-back runs for “sick fever cough,” the new designation being used for patients with Covid-19 symptoms.That April, overwhelmed hospitals running out of beds began discharging far-from-recovered Covid patients to make room for those needing ventilators. Soon, many of the discharged sick-fever coughers, back home and some still wearing their hospital bracelets, would call 911 again. They were still having difficulty breathing.
