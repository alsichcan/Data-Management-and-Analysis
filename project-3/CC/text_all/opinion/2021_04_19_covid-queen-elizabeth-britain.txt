The Solitary Queen Elizabeth: An Iconic Image
To the Editor:Your April 18 front-page photograph of Queen Elizabeth II sitting alone in a choir stall of St. Georgeâ€™s Chapel at the funeral service for her husband, Prince Philip, was indescribably poignant. It was also iconic.I can think of no other image that has so perfectly captured our experience as a world since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic more than a year ago. That solitary woman portrayed it all: grief, isolation, loneliness, and through it all determination, deep faith and incomparable dignity.(Rev.) Edward A. RyanGarden City, N.Y.
