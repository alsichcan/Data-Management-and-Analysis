The Exponential Power of a $15 Wage Floor
President Biden has been very clear. He wants to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 from the current floor of $7.25 an hour. But it’s also clear that it’ll be a tough sell. Republicans have singled out a $15 wage in Mr. Biden’s Covid-relief package as one of the things they object to most. Even some Senate Democrats may not be on board; Joe Manchin and Jon Tester have already voiced opposition. During the deliberations over Mr. Biden’s proposal on the Senate floor this week, a measure that prohibits any minimum wage increase during the pandemic passed on a voice vote, potentially signaling problems down the road.Mr. Biden isn’t out of options if the Senate won’t go along, however. He has the power to unilaterally and directly raise pay for federal contractors by raising their wage floor to $15 an hour, which would affect at least a quarter million Americans, according to an estimate Heidi Shierholz, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, shared with The Times. And the ripple of effects of such an action will reverberate throughout the American work force.“The federal government is such a big buyer of goods and services, it could help lift the entire economy,” Anastasia Christman, director of the Worker Power Program at the National Employment Law Project, told me.Mr. Biden has indicated that he intends to do just this, issuing an executive order on the fourth day of his administration laying the groundwork for eventual direct executive action. All American presidents have the power, through the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act, to determine employment standards for companies that contract with the federal government as long as they promote the “economy and efficiency” of contracting. Contrary to the notion that exercising this authority is an unprecedented power grab, many presidents before Mr. Biden have used it to improve working conditions for millions of Americans.
