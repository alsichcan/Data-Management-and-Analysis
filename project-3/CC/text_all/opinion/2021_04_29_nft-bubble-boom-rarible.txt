For $800, You Too Can Sort of Be In On This Joke
A few weeks ago, while browsing the internet, I came across a dark-blue rectangle for sale: “Monochrome Bleu Numérique.” I zoomed in, then out. I stared for long enough that I wondered whether it might have been a photograph of a photograph. A moment later it appeared to have a grainy texture, suggesting brush strokes on a canvas. But mostly it simply looked like a saturated, unnatural-seeming blue. This digital artwork, stored as a digital file, was for sale online when I first stumbled upon it for 0.3 Ether — the cryptocurrency for the blockchain platform Ethereum — worth more than $800, as of Tuesday night.“Monochrome Bleu Numérique,” which was made by a Vienna-based artist who goes by the name Demian Thirst (he declined to provide his real name), is being sold as a “non-fungible token,” or NFT. NFTs are unique virtual certificates of sole ownership that serve as financial assets and can be attached to everything from famous online videos to a virtual three-course meal. Like an autograph on an otherwise one-in-a-million sports jersey, an NFT offers an assurance of authenticity.This certificate of ownership is verified by blockchain technology — the decentralized public ledgers that record all the financial transactions of participants in the network, somewhat like a massive Google Doc or Google spreadsheet. In 2021, fueled by rising cryptocurrency prices, NFTs have captured the imagination — and bemused ire — of both the art world and the general public.Somewhat puzzlingly, owning an NFT doesn’t mean that you own the given image or thing to which it’s connected, or own the copyright to it. Many NFTs can be downloaded, duplicated, “screenshotted” or simply found elsewhere on the internet.
