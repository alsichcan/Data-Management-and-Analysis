Sherrod Brown Thinks Progressives Will Be ‘Pretty Happy’ With Biden
Early in the morning on Jan. 6, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio woke up pleasantly surprised. Democratic victories in both Georgia Senate runoffs the night before meant he was suddenly poised to become chairman of the Senate Banking and Housing Committee, whose expansive purview includes oversight of the nation’s central bank, our financial system, the housing market and a wide network of executive branch agencies.Only hours later, Mr. Brown found himself sheltering in place in a secure location with 74 other senators as an insurrectionist mob of Trump supporters laid siege to the Capitol building to stop the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory in November’s election.On Tuesday, six days after the attack on the Capitol, still determined to pursue a populist economic agenda amid impeachment debates and the Covid-19 crisis, Mr. Brown briefed me on his hopes for the next stimulus talks, his willingness to work around the filibuster and his priorities for the committee, one the most powerful lawmaking beachheads in Congress.In a statement late yesterday, the senator praised Mr. Biden’s announcement of a $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal as a “bold plan” that “would deliver the results Americans voted for by increasing stimulus checks to $2,000, dramatically expanding the Child Tax Credit and Earned-income tax credit, helping families stay in their homes” and “providing critical funding for the massive vaccine distribution effort we need to overcome this pandemic.” And he urged Congress to “work on this plan quickly.”
