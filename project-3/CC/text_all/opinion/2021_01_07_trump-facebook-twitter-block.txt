Delete All of Trump’s Accounts
It took a riotous mob storming the Capitol building for Facebook to finally take significant action against the president.After four years of race-baiting, lies and hatred spewed from President Trump’s social media accounts, Facebook took the commendable step on Thursday of blocking his account indefinitely. His access won’t be reinstated until at least after Joe Biden is inaugurated, the company said.“The current context is now fundamentally different, involving use of our platform to incite violent insurrection against a democratically elected government,” wrote Facebook’s founder and C.E.O., Mark Zuckerberg. “We believe the risks of allowing the President to continue to use our service during this period are simply too great.”Even as violent Trump supporters overtook the Capitol building on Wednesday, the social media companies’ initial instincts were to leave the president’s posts up — posts in which Mr. Trump expressed sympathy with members of the Capitol mob and continued to lie about the outcome of the November election. Millions of people read and shared them.
