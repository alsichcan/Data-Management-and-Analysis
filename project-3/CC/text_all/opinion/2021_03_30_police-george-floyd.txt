Police-University Partnerships
To the Editor:Re “On Trial’s Eve, Policing Vexes a Scarred City” (front page, March 29):Frustrated at the dearth of even basic data on police killing of civilians, we were heartened by its recent reframing as a public health and safety problem. This may be a model to address some of the incredibly complex issues that face cops on the beat.Like the 18,000 police departments in the country, American medicine is very decentralized. Yet partnerships of hospitals and medical schools produce innovative research that yields superb evidence-based medical care.Could police department/university partnerships be analogs to the hospital/medical school collaborations that have yielded such useful research? The parts of such a system are already in place. Police departments have embraced research and “evidence-based policing.” Universities bring an investigative culture and multiple relevant disciplines. These partnerships would provide a structure for national databases and large-scale research projects.We believe that adding a network of strong police department/university partnerships would be a bold step moving American policing toward the enviable leadership in the world attained by American medicine.
