‘We Cannot Picture Auschwitz’
To the Editor:Re “Can We Really Picture Auschwitz?” (column, April 4):Thank you to Bret Stephens for bringing Buba Weisz Sajovits’s powerful paintings to light. Such art brings us a bit closer to the ineffable. It captures something of the terror, the horror, the trauma.I am grateful that Buba’s story and that of her husband, Luis Stillmann, are being told. Such accounts, as Mr. Stephens notes, “restore the human dimension.” Together with statistics, they tell a story. Details need not be numbing; they edify those who want to know.But the answer to the headline of the column is no. We cannot picture Auschwitz or Bergen-Belsen. I’ve tried. Over decades, I’ve conducted research and visited these sites. In the words of every survivor I know, you had to have been there. No image or film could show what defies the human imagination.Bernice LernerCambridge, Mass.The writer is the author of “All the Horrors of War: A Jewish Girl, a British Doctor and the Liberation of Bergen-Belsen.”
