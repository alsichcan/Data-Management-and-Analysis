Bosses Shouldn’t Demand That You Be Vaccinated
Since banishing the coronavirus from workplaces will be a key to opening the economy — and keeping it open — some companies are considering whether to require their workers to be vaccinated. The chief executive of United Airlines has said he favors making the shots mandatory, and several cruise lines will ask their crews to be vaccinated before returning to work. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has said it is legal for companies to require their employees to get coronavirus vaccines. But these types of mandates are best imposed by governments, not by private companies.Most vaccine mandates in the United States apply to children entering school. These rules, which vary from state to state, have long been the subject of fierce debate. Veterans of those battles know that immunization policy operates at the intersection of important values: Vaccines are medical treatments, symbols of science and progress, opportunities for community solidarity and objects of government power.Given the U.S. government’s failure to control the Covid-19 pandemic and the political polarization of public health policies, it may seem wise to allow private corporations to require coronavirus vaccines. After all, it is common for American bosses to manage or attempt to influence the health of their employees through workplace drug testing, company-funded tobacco cessation programs and discounts on gym memberships. Some hospitals and other employers already require their workers to be inoculated for the flu, for example.But when a company demands that its employees should be vaccinated, this dictate expresses the private power of capital over individuals in ways we should be reluctant to accept. The mere fact that workers and employers are bound together by voluntary contracts doesn’t give bosses license to make medical decisions for their employees. It’s different when the government requires vaccinations, since mandates are typically introduced, removed or modified by democratically elected legislatures, lending legitimacy to public efforts to govern people’s immunization choices.
