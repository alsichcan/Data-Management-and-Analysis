The Many Faces of Post-Trump Stress Disorder
Bret Stephens: Gail, before anything else, I know we are both as one in our sense of heartbreak and horror at the massacre in Georgia. And while it’s not yet entirely clear what exactly motivated this depraved perpetrator, it has sparked an overdue recognition of anti-Asian hate crimes.Gail Collins: Absolutely, Bret. As well as a wrenching regret that this is still a country where, in many places, anybody can walk down to the corner gun shop on a whim and buy a rapid-fire weapon that can kill multiple people in a matter of minutes.Bret: Agree there, too. And a third thing we both agree on is that it’s good to once again have a consoler-in-chief in the White House, not to mention someone who doesn’t stoke racial divisions, like a certain former president I could mention. I don’t mean Millard Fillmore, either.Gail Collins: Bret, I’ve never been a big defender of Millard Fillmore but I do think you’re mostly prejudiced against his name. If he’d been christened, say, Joshua Fillmore, he’d have been just as bad a president, but less memorable.
