Why Your New Year’s Diet Is Doomed
Nearly all of us will fail at our annual round of New Year’s resolutions, which historically are led by eating better and losing weight.But the struggle for your health is not a battle between you and the scale, or you and the brownies. Excessive weight is a symptom — not one of laziness, stupidity or a lack of discipline but of a food system that thrives on pushing junk. The struggle is really between you and the Big Food marketers that sell you that junk — their most profitable products — and politicians who enable them.The war began in earnest in the second half of the 20th century with the development of what we now call ultra-processed foods: new creations that are stripped of nutrients and combined with sugars and artificial ingredients. These are products that, as the Brazilian scientist Carlos Monteiro and his colleagues say, contain ingredients that are “never or rarely used in kitchens.”The development of these products wasn’t inevitable, and it certainly wasn’t “progress.” But it was made super-profitable by a combination of a surplus of grains, advanced manufacturing techniques, a retail system that made shelf life a higher priority than quality or nutrition, and a general failure to limit corporate consolidation. The dominance of ultra-processed foods took hold during the ’70s, when the gradual piling on of work and the resulting lack of personal time made real home cooking difficult or impossible for many people.
