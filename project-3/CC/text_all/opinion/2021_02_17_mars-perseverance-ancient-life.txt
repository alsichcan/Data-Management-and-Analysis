Why Frigid Mars Is the Perfect Place to Look for Ancient Life
Tomorrow afternoon, NASA’s Perseverance rover will hopefully come to rest beneath a butterscotch sky on Mars. I’ll watch the landing unfold on a livestream through Zoom, while the world outside is encased in ice, the trees like pieces of crystal. An ice storm passed through a week ago and the temperature shows no inclination to rise. The deep freeze of February feels like a fitting backdrop for this particular rover’s arrival on Mars.The goal of NASA’s mission is to uncover a once-animate world. Perseverance will collect samples of Mars for eventual return to Earth, rocks that might hold the fingerprints of relic microbial life. For at least the next 687 days, the rover will explore Jezero crater, the site of an ancient river delta, in search of molecular fossils.Early in the solar system’s history, Earth and Mars were remarkably similar. Four and a half billion years ago, both planets had molten births, roiling with the heat of accretion, blooming with magma. Their surfaces then cooled into rocky crusts, replete with water and geologic activity. As life was getting started here, during that hazy time when chemistry gave way to biology, Mars was also a friendly environment. Rivers coursed across its surface, protected by a magnetic field that was spun into existence by the planet’s core. Volcanoes lofted greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, blanketing the planet with warmth.But when Perseverance touches down on Mars on Thursday, it will come to rest on a parched, cold planet. Exposed, bare rocks will be strewn across the quiet landscape. A dust as fine as cigarette smoke will swirl in the air. With luck, the rover’s microphones will capture the sound of the wind, the first sound ever recorded from the planet’s surface, although because of the thin atmosphere, even the most howling gales may sound closer to a whisper.
