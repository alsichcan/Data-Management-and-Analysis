The Republican Party Is Failing in Too Many Ways
Have you heard about the Republican arguments against President Biden’s economic plans? Me neither.It’s not that Republican opposition doesn’t exist. Every Republican in Congress voted against Mr. Biden’s economic recovery package, the American Rescue Plan.But roughly 100 days into Mr. Biden’s presidency, as he has proceeded with spending plans that the administration and friendly observers have increasingly described in historic terms — as an update to and expansion of the New Deal and a wholesale reorientation of the relationship between the federal government and the economy — the Republican opposition has largely been a matter of dull reflex.What Republicans haven’t done is make a concerted public argument against Democratic economic policies. One complication is that to do so would be to engage in hypocrisy so blatant and obvious that it would negate any impact. But this stems partly from a deeper problem, which is that the party no longer has a cognizable theory of government.Republicans spent the presidency of Barack Obama leveling attacks on Democratic fiscal policy: Debt and deficits were out of control, they said, and spending restraint had disappeared. The Tea Party was, at least at first, nominally a movement in response to Obama-era economic policy — the stimulus in the wake of the housing market crash and then the Affordable Care Act — that conservative activists saw as overreach.
