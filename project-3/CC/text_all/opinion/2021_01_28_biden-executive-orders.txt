Swift Action by Biden to Reverse Trump Policies
To the Editor:Re “Ease Up on the Executive Orders” (editorial, Jan. 28):It’s true that legislation provides greater stability and accountability than do executive orders. But Joe Biden wasn’t elected president to plead for bold action by a divided Congress while his predecessor’s policies continue unchecked.President Biden has acknowledged the need for legislation. And his long tenure as a lawmaker in Washington means he knows what it takes for a bill to become law. Yet while Democrats and Republicans in the Senate hash out their differences, Mr. Biden has appropriately taken swift action on the most pressing issues facing society — the pandemic, climate change, racial justice, the economy.The job of Congress is to legislate. But when Congress isn’t doing its job, the president has every right to use the power of the pen, within the bounds of the law, to advance his agenda. I hope this Congress works with the president. Until then, I hope the president continues upholding his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed.Kevin Y. ChenCambridge, Mass.To the Editor:While times have changed since President Lyndon Baines Johnson submitted and saw Congress enact more than 100 bills in each of the 89th and 90th Congresses, your editorial correctly points out that legislation enshrines presidential desires into laws agreed to by multiple centers of political power.
