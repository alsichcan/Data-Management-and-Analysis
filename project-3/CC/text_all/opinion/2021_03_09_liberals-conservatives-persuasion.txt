Is Humility, Not Righteousness, the Key to Persuasion?
To the Editor:Re “The Secrets of Winning Over People Who Are Wrong,” by Nicholas Kristof (column, March 4):I have never read or heard an anti-liberal (I’ll just categorize Mr. Kristof’s unnamed opponents as that) say that they must find a way to listen better to liberals/progressives. If that were a principle they ever recognized, I might be convinced to play along. But no.And I’ve seen too many liberals with the same lament as Mr. Kristof, as if we should bear some guilt or shame for being on the right side of a long history. Would Mr. Kristof have written a similar piece encouraging Lincoln and the North to listen more closely to Southern slave interests?We have listened long enough, if not far too long. Progress, justice and reason have too long been subverted by anti-liberals using nothing more than lies and obstruction. Certainly there are times and places for talk and persuasion. But there are also critical mass moments when there are not.As Stacey Abrams showed in Georgia, since we can no longer persuade our opponents, we must simply organize and outvote them, and deny them their minority power.
