The Chaebolization of Big Tech Has Made Its Way to America
When Moon Jae-in, South Korea’s president, meets with President Biden at the White House on Friday, many will watch with North Korea on their minds. But Mr. Biden may be consumed with something else. Demand for electronics during the coronavirus pandemic and concerns over the global supply in the U.S.-China “trade war” have caused a shortage of semiconductors, those magical bits of silicon or gallium arsenide that power nearly every digital aspect of our lives.The United States has long relied on East Asia to supplement Intel’s production of semiconductors, and the region has risen in tandem with the sector at great human and ecological cost. On Thursday, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo hosted a virtual summit with Asian and U.S. semiconductor makers. Invitees included Samsung, the company responsible for nearly one-fifth of South Korea’s G.D.P. and one of the top two manufacturers of semiconductors; the Seoul-based SK Group is also in the top five. Both are among South Korea’s chaebols, the heavily state-subsidized, family-owned corporate conglomerates that have dominated the country’s economy since the 1960s.Given the apparent desperation of U.S. businesses for more microprocessors — the chief executive of Ford blamed the shortage for the halving of his company’s production in the second quarter of this year — the administration will most likely broker whatever trade it can. But in looking to South Korean chaebols to meet the nation’s needs, Mr. Biden may indirectly bolster a handful of corporations with a terrible grip on the country’s economy.According to the logic of conglomerated South Korea, a few large firms control most industries and determine both supply and demand, funneling wealth to the top. The chaebols are inescapable: As the novelist Kim Young-ha has written, an average South Korean could begin her day in a Samsung-built apartment, watch a video on a Samsung smartphone and get informed by a news broadcast on a Samsung TV, all paid for on a Samsung credit card.
