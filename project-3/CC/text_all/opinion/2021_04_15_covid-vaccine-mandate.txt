But four months into the U.S. vaccination drive, there are already signs of rain: In several states now, vaccine supply appears on the verge of outstripping demand, even as the country remains at least some 100 million immunizations away from herd immunity.Faced with the prospect of a protracted public health crisis, a growing number of colleges and employers have said they will require their students and workers to get vaccinated. Such mandates played an important role in fighting smallpox in the United States a century ago. Are they a necessary step in the path toward herd immunity or an unethical, potentially illegal policy that could set the country back? Here’s what people are saying.It depends on who would be doing the requiring.Private vaccine mandates have broadly been considered legal:For government mandates, it’s a little more complicated:Covid vaccine mandates will almost certainly encounter legal trouble, whatever form they take. That’s because the Food and Drug Administration has authorized them for only emergency use. Under the 2004 federal law that governs emergency use authorization, or E.U.A., individuals must be informed “of the option to accept or refuse administration of the product, of the consequences, if any, of refusing administration of the product.” Many legal experts have interpreted this language to mean that mandatory Covid vaccination would be illegal until the F.D.A. grants full approval.
