Republicans’ Reluctance to Convict Trump
To the Editor:Re “Rallying Against Trial, G.O.P. Senators Signal a 2nd Trump Acquittal” (front page, Jan. 27):The vote by Republican senators against holding an impeachment trial doesn’t necessarily mean they plan to vote to acquit Donald Trump. What it shows is that most of them don’t want to have to go on the record either way.Clearly too cowardly to vote to convict despite overwhelming evidence of Mr. Trump’s guilt, the average G.O.P. senator also doesn’t want to stain his or her personal legacy forever by voting to acquit. After all, the senators have to explain themselves to children and grandchildren.What to do? Ideally they vote to prevent the trial from happening, an attempt by Rand Paul that has now failed. Next best thing? Expect a number of G.O.P. senators to “call in sick” on the day of the vote. A conviction by two-thirds of senators “present and voting” requires only a handful of G.O.P. senators.Steven BavariaBoca Raton, Fla.To the Editor:Re “G.O.P. Wavers on Punishing Trump as Impeachment Article Goes to Senate” (news article, Jan. 26):It is not surprising to learn that the main factor for most Republican senators in determining their vote on the impeachment charge against the former president is not whether he is guilty as charged, but rather the effect of their vote on their own political futures. But it is still shocking to behold the breathtaking level of cynicism in the remark by Senator Lindsey Graham, who said, “with a chuckle,” that “it depends on what state you’re in and what phase in your career you are.”
