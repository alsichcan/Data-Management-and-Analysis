Cheating Accusations at Dartmouth’s Medical School
To the Editor:Re “Cheating Charges at Dartmouth Show Pitfalls of Tech Tracking” (front page, May 9):When Dartmouth’s Geisel School of Medicine tried to prevent cheating on its remote examinations, the goal was to give all students a level playing field and to achieve fair exam results. Dartmouth tried to ensure fair results by monitoring (and thus preventing) student access to information during the examination.This method strikes me as close to impossible: Monitoring of internet use is fallible. And how can one hope to control access to books and to knowledgeable roommates?I suggest that a second way might show more promise. Examinations could use questions on which “cheating” would be of no help: Ask students questions that require analytical thinking and encourage them to use any books and internet resources that they desire to answer these questions. They will thus be tested on their analytical thinking and also on their ability to access information — both skills that are important for doctors (and for everyone) in the world today.Alice L.
