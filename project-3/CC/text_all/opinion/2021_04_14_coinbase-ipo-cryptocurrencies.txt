Don’t Fear Cryptocurrencies. Manage Them.
Since last fall, cryptocurrencies — digital tokens that represent monetary value, stored on completely decentralized networks of public digital ledgers — have boomed. It’s led to a bullish frenzy among those who see them as a generational wealth-creation opportunity or view themselves as the eventual survivors of an inflation-driven collapse of traditional currencies like the U.S. dollar.But since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009, cryptocurrencies have been a source of consternation for big institutional investors and government regulators. They worry that cryptocurrencies could interfere with central banks’ monetary policy and invite money laundering, ransomware and scams. But cryptocurrencies appear to be here to stay: In a sign of major investors’ increasing comfort with the “crypto” ecosystem, Coinbase Inc., the largest U.S. cryptocurrency exchange, currently valued at $68 billion, will go public with a direct listing on the Nasdaq stock index on Wednesday.Opponents of regulatory action warn that more explicit rules for cryptocurrency markets are bound to depress trading activity because they will spook investors. That, as they see it, is both an unfair way to treat a new, innovative financial asset and a futile effort, because trading activity will simply shift to more permissive jurisdictions. Cryptocurrency skeptics, in turn, cheered when senior officials in both the Trump and Biden administrations made negative statements about Bitcoin, believing their remarks would cut down on rampant speculation in a heavily manipulated market.Some of our most consequential public policy debates concern how regulators should address new technologies. Gene editing, artificial intelligence and derivatives in high finance have all recently taken turns in the harsh spotlight. Now, it seems, it’s cryptocurrency’s turn.
