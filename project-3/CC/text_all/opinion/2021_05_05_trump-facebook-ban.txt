Should Trump Be Permanently Barred From Facebook?
To the Editor:Re “Trump’s Facebook Ban Upheld, Reviving Debate on Free Speech” (front page, May 6):Facebook’s Oversight Board has given the company six months to consider whether Donald Trump should be permanently banned or should be subject to a lesser penalty. Mr. Trump is a dangerous person of poor character, as shown by his four chaotic years as president followed by his refusal to concede a duly conducted election and attempts to overturn it.His abuse of democratic norms is more than enough to earn a permanent ban. But if Facebook, after careful consideration, decides to impose a lesser penalty, it is imperative that it include a written concession of the 2020 election and an unambiguous apology for trying to subvert the election.Experience demonstrates that no penalty is likely to constrain Mr. Trump’s mendacity, but this is the very least that can be required to again allow him easy access to a country he has so sorely abused.Nicholas W.
