Learning to Live With Low Fertility
Last week the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported much higher inflation than almost anyone predicted, and inflationistas — people who always predict runaway price rises, and have always been wrong — seized on the news as proof that this time the wolf is real.Financial markets, however, took it in stride. Stocks fell on the report, but they soon made up most of the losses.Bond yields rose only slightly on the news, then ended the week right where they started — namely, extremely low.Why so little reaction to the inflation news? Part of the answer, presumably, was that once investors had time to digest the details they realized that there was little sign of a rise in underlying inflation; this was a blip reflecting what were probably one-time rises in the prices of used cars and hotel rooms.
