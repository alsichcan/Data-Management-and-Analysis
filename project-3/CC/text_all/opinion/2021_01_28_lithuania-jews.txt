Her Grandfather, and the Destruction of Lithuania’s Jews
To the Editor:Re “My Celebrated Grandfather Had an Unforgivable Past” (Op-Ed, Jan. 28):As a granddaughter of a Lithuanian Jew, I welcome Silvia Foti’s honest historical account of her Lithuanian grandfather’s collaboration with the Nazis during World War II. Though my grandfather had the courage and good fortune to come to the United States well before the war, his parents and most of his siblings remained and were murdered.The Lithuanian Jewish population was more than 160,000 before World War II and is now estimated to be between 2,700 and 6,500. Germans have done a good job of teaching younger generations the truth about Germany’s role in the Holocaust. Let’s hope that Ms. Foti’s work will set the record straight for Lithuanians, present and future.Alice R. MachinistAuburndale, Mass.To the Editor:I am grateful to Silvia Foti for having the courage to speak the truth about her grandfather, whom she describes as a Nazi for his crimes against Lithuania’s Jews.My mother was one of those Jews. At 1, she and her parents — my grandparents — were herded into the Kovno ghetto, where they lived for three years in squalor, starvation and the ever-present fear of being killed.
