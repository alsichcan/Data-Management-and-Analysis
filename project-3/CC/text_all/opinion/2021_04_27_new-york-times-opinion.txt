They’ll Miss the Term ‘Op-Ed’
To the Editor:Re “Why We’re Retiring the Term ‘Op-Ed,’” by Kathleen Kingsbury (Opinion, April 27):People and opinion pages should be called whatever they want to be called, but your decision to rename Op-Eds the pedestrian “guest essays” seems wrongheaded. It is an argument against etymology.So what if Op-Ed is a relic of a fading print presence? Words and phrases often betray their origins: Someone on an even keel is not necessarily on a boat. A person can be sinister and not left-handed.Of course, I’ll continue to avidly consume your guest essays, but I’ll miss the term Op-Ed.Jack ShermanNorthport, N.Y.To the Editor:I understand your wish to retire the term Op-Ed and replace it with something more in tune with how articles in today’s Times are published. But the term “guest essay” doesn’t sing. I wish you had instead chosen “guest opinion,” which rolls off the tongue more easily. It also invites shortening to “guest-op,” which would have appealed to us nostalgics who will miss the old name.
