The Perpetual Crisis at the Border — and What We Can Do About It
MIAMI — The U.S.-Mexico border is a “bleeding scar.” That is how Mexican author Carlos Fuentes described it in 1997. According to the Pew Research Center, 1.2 million immigrants, authorized and unauthorized, entered the United States that year. Back then, just like now, there was talk of an overwhelming crisis at the border.In fact, the border has always been in crisis. The broad contours of the modern border were first established in 1848, with the end of the Mexican-American War. When I was in elementary school in Mexico City, I learned that the signing that year of the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo put an end to the conflict and the American invasion, and that Mexico was forced to cede 55 percent of its territory to the United States with a compensation of $15 million. Back then, the reality is that a lot of people didn’t cross the border. The border crossed them.Ever since then, the border has been a region defined by both conflict and extraordinary brotherhood. And for as long as I can remember there have been debates over the people who cross the border from the south and how many should be allowed to do so each year.Beginning with Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, I’ve had the chance as a journalist to cover the immigration policies of every U.S. president. As we face today’s border crisis, the history of these policies must be reviewed in order to find a long-term solution — one that must involve accepting many more authorized immigrants. It’s clear that America’s immigration system is broken and outdated; it doesn’t reflect the new needs of the United States or its southern neighbors.
