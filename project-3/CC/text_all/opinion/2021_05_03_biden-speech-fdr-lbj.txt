Joe Biden Was No One’s Idea of a Historic Figure
Bret Stephens: Well, Gail, that was some speech last week from President Franklin Baines Biden.Gail Collins: Bret, is that supposed to be an insult? I’ll bet if Joe Biden learns you’ve compared him to Franklin Roosevelt, he’ll feel pretty chipper.Bret: No insult. Just an apt historical comparison.Gail: And he probably wouldn’t mind being thought of as a guy with L.B.J.’s domestic chops either. Remember the civil rights bill and the Voting Rights Act?Bret: What I was mainly thinking about was the Great Society and the war on poverty. I don’t think they worked out quite as well as planned.Gail: Well, Lyndon would want civil and voting rights in his Great Society basket.Bret: Here is where I state for the record that the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 were the greatest legislative achievements of the past 100 years.
