Big Pharma and the Covid Vaccines
To the Editor:Re “Big Pharma Is Fooling Us,” by Stephen Buranyi (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, Dec. 17):Mr. Buranyi claims that Big Pharma staged a “public relations coup” by taking credit for vaccine breakthroughs that “wouldn’t exist without public support through every step of their development.” He argues that the companies should waive their patents.Without Big Pharma’s capital and technical know-how, we wouldn’t have Covid-19 vaccines at all — much less two approved in less than a year and others expected within months.The government does fund academic researchers, who make important discoveries on basic scientific questions. But Big Pharma and small biotechs take huge risks to turn those insights into real-world medicines. Biopharmaceutical firms invested $102 billion in research and development in 2018 — roughly three times what the National Institutes of Health spent that year.Private drug companies fund the lion’s share of R&D, including for Covid-19. It’s only fair they take credit for their lifesaving breakthroughs.
