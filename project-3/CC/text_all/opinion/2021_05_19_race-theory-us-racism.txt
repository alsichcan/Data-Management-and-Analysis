Does Teaching America Itâ€™s Racist Make It Less Racist?
Who would have guessed that a school of thought from the 1970s could cause controversy in a handful of states among politicians, on school boards and in college classrooms in 2021?Critical race theory originated as a way of examining racism within the structures of American society.
