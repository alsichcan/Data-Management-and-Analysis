As Vaccines Abound, So Do the Questions
To the Editor:So we now have Republican pundits and legislators railing against the concept of proof of vaccination, because it will somehow abrogate their liberties. To them, I ask, “How about the liberty of people to travel overseas?”International travel, admission to museums and concerts overseas, and ability to fly or go on a cruise are all heading toward mandating proof of vaccination. Even domestically, eventually many private businesses, including gyms, restaurants, concert venues and movie houses, are likely going to mandate proof of vaccination. Israel has already addressed this with a secure app.What is the problem with these politicians, who are already blaming the Biden administration for what are really private nongovernmental efforts from I.T. professionals to create this software?Jeffrey KaufmanNeedham, Mass.To the Editor:Re “Italy Begins Requiring Health Care Workers to Get Vaccine or Lose Pay” (news article, April 1):Health care workers have the right to refuse vaccination. However, they do not have the right to put their patients at risk for disease and actually have an ethical and moral responsibility to reduce harm. If health care workers, for whatever reason, do not get a vaccine, they should remove themselves from the health care setting.
