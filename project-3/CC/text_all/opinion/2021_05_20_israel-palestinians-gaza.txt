A Call for ‘a Bit More Empathy’ on Israel and Gaza
To the Editor:F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote that the test of a first-rate intelligence is the ability to function while holding two opposing ideas in mind at the same time. Perhaps that’s needed in the Israel-Palestine debate.We can unreservedly condemn the indiscriminate rocket attacks on Israeli civilians by Hamas while holding Israel’s democratically elected government accountable for excessive use of force and the collective punishment and possible war crimes against Gaza residents. We can wholeheartedly defend Israel’s right to exist and protect itself while understanding the hurt and anger of generations of Palestinians living as refugees in their own homeland under the indignity of occupation.We can disapprove of America’s one-sided, uncritical support of Israel while pointing out the roles played by Arab countries, often sacrificing the Palestinians for their own domestic political reasons.The Middle East conflict is a chicken-and-egg conundrum fraught with political, historical and religious legacies and no easy solutions. A bit more empathy and putting ourselves in each party’s shoes may be a good start.
