Is It Time to Abolish the Monarchy?
To the Editor:Re “Down With the British Monarchy,” by Hamilton Nolan (Op-Ed, nytimes.com, March 10):Mr. Nolan has done a hilarious job of depicting Britain’s continuation of its monarchy as a wasteful anachronism. This lavish expenditure of the commoners’ tax money may have had its place hundreds of years ago before the advent of British democracy.The king or queen then actually had a real job — running a government, defending the country from invaders, deciding how public funds should be spent. The head that bore the crown often had to risk it on the battlefield. The nonhereditary have that job today.Maybe the British would wake up from this foolishness if Americans weren’t so enthralled with the royals and didn’t flock to Buckingham Palace in the hopes of glimpsing the queen or at least provoking a guard into a smile.Alan MassBrooklynTo the Editor:Hamilton Nolan must have used considerable restraint not to utter the phrase “off with their heads.” He misses the fundamental point of the monarchy today: stability in the head of state. Despite all the many flaws that come with Britain’s monarchy, few anti-monarchists would likely describe the current queen as a “wastrel.” Her nearly 70 years of peerless dedication to the public are testament to that.
