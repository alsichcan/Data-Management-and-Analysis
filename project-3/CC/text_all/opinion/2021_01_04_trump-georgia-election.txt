Trump Wants to ‘Find’ Votes in Georgia
To the Editor:Re “On Tape, Trump Pushes Georgia to ‘Find’ Votes” (front page, Jan. 4):Is President Trump delusional and does he truly believe that he won the November election? Is he an autocratic leader attempting to stage a coup? Does he believe that the laws and the Constitution don’t apply to him, or does he not know what our laws and Constitution say?Regardless of the explanation of his behavior, this president has gone beyond the pale in his call to the Georgia secretary of state to urge him to “find” more votes. Kudos to Brad Raffensperger for standing firm.But what about the Republican lemmings who are ready to run off the edge of a cliff to follow their leader? Every one of them should be crying out against his reprehensible behavior and refusing to take part in the sideshow being planned in Congress on Wednesday when the electoral votes of the states are certified.It is a sad time for our country that they are unlikely to turn back.Dorothy CantorNew YorkTo the Editor:Put aside the blatant threats, patent coercion and unmitigated falsehoods rife in Donald Trump’s telephone rant to Georgia’s secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger; the call was a criminal act, an outright solicitation of election fraud that must not go unpunished.
