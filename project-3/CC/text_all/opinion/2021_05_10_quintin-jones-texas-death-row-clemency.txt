Quintin Jones Is Not Innocent. But He Doesn’t Deserve to Die.
My world had narrowed to a tiny, white-walled, fluorescent-lit hospital room in New York in 2012. I was 23 and enduring a seemingly hopeless struggle with leukemia, and I had spent much of the previous year in medical isolation, at times too sick to speak. I’d never felt so alone.That’s when I got my first letter from a man in Texas named Quintin Phillippe Jones, Quin for short. He’d read an essay I’d written about what I described as my “incanceration” and he wanted me to know that my words had touched “a death-row convict heart.” I noticed the handwriting — wrought and elegant. I felt a kind of vertigo, knowing it was from a man who had committed a heinous crime.In 1999, when Quin was 20 years old and on heroin and cocaine, he killed his great-aunt Berthena Bryant for $30 to buy more drugs. Following a trial, he was convicted of her murder. Based on this conviction and his alleged involvement in two other killings, for which he was never charged, the prosecution argued during the penalty phase that Quin was beyond redemption and that he would continue to be a mortal threat. The jury sentenced him to die.
