Social Media and a Surveillance Society
To the Editor:Re “The Knowledge Coup,” by Shoshana Zuboff (Sunday Review, Jan. 31):While there’s a whole lot of truth in Dr. Zuboff’s epic take on big data’s “epistemic coup,” her thinking reflects an underlying conviction that people can be cynically managed by repetitive exposure to machine-curated misinformation.As someone who’s often involved in the targeting and message-making side of both brand and political campaigns, I think the evidence paints a more nuanced picture — that data-driven persuasion is generally limited to leveraging existing biases versus converting the ideologically unwashed. For proof, you don’t have to look much further than the most recent election cycle, where Democrats, despite a major digitally delivered persuasion advantage, failed to convert success at the top of the ticket into a blue wave.It’s not that Democrats didn’t have the ability to harness teraflops of surveillance-based insights as reasons to reject Trumpian allies and enablers. It’s just that purple voters knew what they already knew and all the pejorative pixels, grievance-based GIFs and haranguing hashtags in the world weren’t going to tell them otherwise.Take that into account and, tempting as it is, you really can’t blame surveillance capitalism for the roughly 70 percent of Republicans who counterfactually insist on #stopthesteal. They’d long since bought into Donald Trump’s claim that the only way he could lose an election was if it was rigged.
