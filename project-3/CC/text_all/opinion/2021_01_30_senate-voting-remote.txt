The Senate Needs Absentee Voting, Too
The Senate Democratic caucus was hit with a pair of unsettling health developments this week.Late Tuesday afternoon, a spokesman for Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont announced that Mr. Leahy had been taken to a Washington hospital for observation after feeling unwell. This was done at the recommendation of the Capitol’s attending physician, “out of an abundance of caution.”After a few hours, Mr. Leahy had been evaluated and was released. He “looks forward to getting back to work,” his spokesman reassured the public. Mr. Leahy, who is 80, later attributed the episode to muscle spasms and said he had been given “a clean bill of health.”On Wednesday evening, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia announced that he was quarantining after possible exposure to the coronavirus. The senator had tested negative but would “be working remotely during his quarantine period,” his spokeswoman said, “out of an abundance of caution.”With caution at the forefront of senators’ minds, the chamber’s new leadership should get serious about enabling members to vote remotely in the event of health emergencies.
