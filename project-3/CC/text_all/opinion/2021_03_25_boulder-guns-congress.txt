‘Tell Congress It’s Time to Step Up’ on Gun Control
To the Editor:Another mass killing by someone with an assault weapon. I’m so tired of hearing about these events. I’m tired of the arguments from those who claim it’s their right to own such a weapon for self-defense. I’m tired of the platitudes and “thoughts and prayers” from elected officials. And what I’m really tired of, and outraged by, is the inaction by Congress to do anything about the incessant stream of murders by perpetrators using these weapons.What about my right to live in a safe community? What about my right to be able to go shopping, or to a restaurant, a park, a concert, a nightclub, without fear of being murdered by someone with a weapon designed expressly for mass killing?What about the rights of my children and grandchildren to complete their education, work in a safe place, get married and raise a family, and grow to a ripe old age, without worrying about being gunned down by someone with a grievance that has nothing to do with them? When will our elected leaders take steps to stop this carnage?Congress must require background checks for all buyers, and assault weapons and large magazines should be permanently banned.
