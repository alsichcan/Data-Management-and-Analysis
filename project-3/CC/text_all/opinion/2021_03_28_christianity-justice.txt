Christian Social Justice, Redux
To the Editor:Re “A Christian Vision of Social Justice” (column, March 19):Seldom have I seen the answer to the quandary of how to respond to the state of our country, in which racism seems to be more visible and inequality has been rising, put more clearly than by David Brooks. He offers the wisdom of the New Testament scholar Esau McCaulley that we need to view all people in our society as worthy of our love and respect, first of all as children of God, in order to make progress toward a better society.With that underlying view, we can try to forgive the malevolent and help bring them back to a universal brotherhood. What a radical viewpoint, and worthy of our deepest attention. Perhaps this is the antidote we need in a period of our history when hate and selfish behavior seem to rule the day.Louise HorvathPittsburghTo the Editor:As I read David Brooks’s column, Jesus’ words echoed in my mind. He said: “Do you think that I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division!” Jesus calls us to a different kind of division. Not a kind that separates us one from another. But instead into a divide between a white supremacist present, where there are people considered more valuable than others, and a future where all are valued as the sacred children of God that they are.To reach a future without the divides that separate, we must strive not for reconciliation but justice. Reconciliation follows justice, not the other way around. And justice requires more than forgiveness and apologies to promote good feelings, as our country remains trapped in the sin of white supremacy.
