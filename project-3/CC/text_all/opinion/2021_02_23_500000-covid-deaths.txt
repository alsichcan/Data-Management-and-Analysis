‘The Unfathomable Toll of More Than 500,000 Souls Lost’
To the Editor:Re “White House Holds Memorial as Nation Passes 500,000 Virus Deaths” (news article, Feb. 23):I watched President Biden’s somber Covid memorial marking the unfathomable toll of more than 500,000 souls lost. As an American desperate for some semblance of leadership from and trust in our president, I watched as the granddaughter of a loving grandfather who was taken too soon by this virus.The need for public acknowledgment and collective grieving is overwhelming. The absence of anything to mark the crushing, warlike loss from the last administration was glaring. More than just for posterity, our country craves some kinship with our president. We are contending with a crisis not solvable in the ways Americans typically cope with chaos and strain.We as human beings have been robbed of natural and healing ways of grieving and achieving closure. We cannot say goodbye to our loved ones; we cannot hold funerals; we cannot even hold one another to share in this unimaginable grief.President Biden, in his decency and his own experience with loss, understands this innate need and is providing a very distraught people with some empathy, comfort and simple humanity. He also understands the power of a quiet and understated ceremony.
