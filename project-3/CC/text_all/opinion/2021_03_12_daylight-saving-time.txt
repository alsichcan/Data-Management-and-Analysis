Learning to Love Daylight Saving Time
Americans in every state except Arizona and Hawaii will lose an hour of sleep this weekend as the nation ushers in daylight saving time, and you may join me in wondering why we’re torturing ourselves. Why do we use one time-keeping system for 34 weeks and a different system the other 18? Why not pick one and stick with it?In recent years, 15 states, beginning with Florida in 2018, have passed laws or resolutions to stay on summer time throughout the year, if federal law is changed to allow it. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has gone one step further, introducing legislation to put the entire country, except Arizona and Hawaii, on perpetual daylight saving time.My first instinct was enthusiasm for more evening sunshine and an end to springing forward and falling back. But the longer I looked at the idea, the less I liked it. There are interesting arguments for going all in on daylight saving time and, in my view, even better arguments for saying goodbye to daylight saving time. But our current split system, for all its frustrations, remains the best answer for the United States.This column is about a problem we shouldn’t fix.Daylight saving time is a way to align the hours of daylight with the hours that people are awake. In winter, people generally rise in the dark and go to bed in the dark. But in summer, the sun rises before most people do, and that is something of a waste.
