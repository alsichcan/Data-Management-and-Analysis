Adam Kinzinger, I Can Relate: When Politics Divides Families
To the Editor:Re “Lonely Quest to Repudiate Trump Wing” (front page, Feb. 16):I am saddened by what Representative Adam Kinzinger, a Republican who voted for impeachment, is dealing with from his family — in tears as I type this. I can somewhat relate: I received a communication (email) from my father after we disagreed on politics (I support Joe Biden, he supports Donald Trump) telling me that I’d been “canceled” and my sister-in-law was now his daughter.It is a tough blow to receive this sort of message from a family member, but I hope that Mr. Kinzinger takes comfort from knowing that many of us who are not his family are proud of him, and hope he is able to hang tough and stand tall for having voted and spoken his conscience.If I were an Illinois resident, I would switch from voting Democratic to vote for him. I hope he has family and friends who are standing by him and comforting him with love and support for his honesty and integrity.In my case, a week after the stinging and hurtful email, I received a call and a sincere apology. We are back in touch and agreeing not to discuss politics. I hope for a positive outcome for Mr. Kinzinger as well.
