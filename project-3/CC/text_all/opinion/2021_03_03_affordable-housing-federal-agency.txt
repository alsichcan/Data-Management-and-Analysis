What Happens When 10 Million Tenants Can’t Make Rent?
What happens when 10 million tenants can’t make rent?Dire conditions for vulnerable tenants also mean financial distress for landlords. Things have been particularly difficult for “mom and pop” landlords, particularly those who operate in the affordable market. In an October survey of smaller landlords, 30 percent reported increased pressure to sell their property, due to fallout from the pandemic.Yet investors looking to profit from the fallout have referred to this hardship as the “greatest buying opportunity of the century.” They are already preparing to acquire these distressed properties, sitting on more than $300 billion in “dry powder” for this purpose.The 2008 financial crisis showed the impact of an enormous transfer of wealth and property out of the hands of families and communities and into the portfolios of Wall Street. To prevent a similarly disastrous outcome, we need to act now and foster a large-scale expansion of social housing.We propose the creation of the Social Housing Development Authority, a federal agency that would purchase distressed real estate, ensure it is livable and environmentally sound, and finance its transfer to the so-called social housing sector, including tenant cooperatives, community land trusts, nonprofits or public housing.
