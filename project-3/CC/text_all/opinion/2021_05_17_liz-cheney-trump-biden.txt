Liz Cheney Wants Her Party Back. The Feeling Is Not Mutual.
Gail Collins: Well Bret, I feel obliged to start us off with Liz Cheney. Kicked out of Republican leadership, but not giving up on her Trump-lost-the-election message, and still attached to a party that seems doomed to never, ever get its act together.Bret Stephens: I bet you never imagined you’d someday find yourself thinking: “What America really needs are more Republicans like Liz Cheney!”Gail: Well, yeah, it hadn’t really come up. …Bret: I’ve always liked her. She was one of the few elected Republicans willing to criticize Trump openly during his presidency. Our foreign policy views are hawkishly in tune. And she understands that the U.S. can’t hold itself up as some kind of paragon of liberal democracy when one party is in thrall to a mendacious Mussolini manqué whose only saving grace is that he lacked the guile of a Vladimir Putin to competently steal the election.Gail: Mendacious Mussolini manqué is pretty good. At least for us elders. But go on.Bret: What the vote says about the Reprobate-tarian Party — as it should now be called — is another story. What do you think?
