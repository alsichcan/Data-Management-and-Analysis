How to Help Stressed-Out Teenagers
To the Editor:Re “Teen Anguish in the Pandemic,” by Emily Esfahani Smith (Sunday Review, May 9):As clinicians and educators, we have witnessed the escalating rates of anxiety and depression among high-achieving youths. America’s decades-long trends of harsher competition, globalization, social media comparisons, endless striving on behalf of an uncertain future and scarce admissions to brand-name colleges have created a culture of fear and anxiety.The resultant “all or nothing” thinking about the path to the “good life” leaves little room for youths to learn from mistakes while building resilience. Instead, a vicious feedback loop arises, equating an A-minus with failure.Parents and youths must let go of unrealistic expectations. High-achieving schools and colleges must also reconsider their roles. They can modify their admissions, curriculums, and methods of teaching and evaluating student performance. Many educators are promoting resilience through social-emotional education, helping youths gain the skills to thrive.Anthony L. RostainB.
