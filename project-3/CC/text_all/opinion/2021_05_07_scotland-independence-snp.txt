Does Scotland Really Want Independence?
GLASGOW — For Scots of my generation — millennial and younger — the belief that Scotland would be better off running its own affairs, free from the strictures of Westminster, is almost axiomatic. From the Iraq war to Brexit, the financial crash to austerity, Britain feels trapped in a spiral of crisis and decline. According to a September analysis of recent polls, more than 70 percent of Scots under the age of 35 think Scotland should abandon the United Kingdom. And the abrasive right-wing premiership of Boris Johnson, increasingly mired in accusations of cronyism and sleaze, has only strengthened that view.At the other end of the spectrum, Scotland’s older, asset-owning classes remain staunchly opposed to a political breakup and the economic instability it might entail. An election this week should show which side has the wind at its back.On Thursday, Scots voted to elect members of the Scottish Parliament. The ballots are still being counted and the final result won’t be confirmed until this weekend. Throughout the campaign, however, the polls were strikingly consistent: All signs point to a pro-independence majority held either exclusively by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon’s separatist Scottish National Party or with its ally, the left-leaning Scottish Greens.The S.N.P. manifesto is clear on holding another referendum on Scottish independence as soon as the “Covid crisis is over” — late 2023 has been suggested. And if Scots have voted for a pro-independence majority, that might seem like an endorsement of that plan. The reality is more complicated.
