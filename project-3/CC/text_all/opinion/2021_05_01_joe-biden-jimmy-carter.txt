The Jimmy Carter and Joe Biden Show
WASHINGTON — Joe Biden has respect for his elders. And there aren’t that many of them.Before the president’s rally near Atlanta on Thursday, he and Jill went out of their way to pay respects to the 96-year-old Jimmy Carter.This made Biden the first president to make a pilgrimage to Plains since Carter left office, unless you count Yasir Arafat.If there’s a pol who knows what it feels like to be underappreciated by his own party, it’s Biden. And he wasn’t going to continue to let Carter, at the end of his life, be treated like a pariah in peanutville.“Pretty much every Democratic convention from 1984 until 2020, there was some kind of an issue over, ‘How do we deal with Jimmy Carter?’” said Jonathan Alter, the author of “His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life.” “He was still in bad odor not just in the country, but in parts of the Democratic Party.”
