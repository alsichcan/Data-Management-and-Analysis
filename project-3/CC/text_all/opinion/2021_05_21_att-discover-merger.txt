AT&T’s Sorry Retreat From Digital Media
On Monday, the wireless-telephone behemoth AT&T gave up the ghost in its pricey and ambitious plans to transform itself into a media giant by announcing that it was spinning off WarnerMedia into a merger with Discovery.It was a complete about-face from its once-touted strategy to take on Big Tech and dominate the next phase of the information age. AT&T’s top executive tried mightily this week to make the deal look like a win for his company by painting a picture of vast sums of money well spent. It was anything but that.What AT&T is getting back in the deal is well below the more than $85 billion that AT&T paid only three years ago to purchase Time Warner, which included media gems like CNN and HBO. That’s why some analysts have made a persuasive case that the AT&T chief executive, John Stankey — who spearheaded the 2018 deal, as well as AT&T’s disastrous acquisition of DirecTV three years before that — is the worst media strategist in recent memory.
