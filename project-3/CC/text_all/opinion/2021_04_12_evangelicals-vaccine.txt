Vaccine Resistance Among Evangelicals
To the Editor:Re “White Evangelical Resistance Is Obstacle in Vaccination Effort” (front page, April 5):I’m 69 years old and have had both my shots, and I thank God for that. I feel blessed to live in this country, where our government makes it so easy to get vaccinated for free. I compare my situation to people who live in poor countries where they may have to wait seemingly forever to get vaccinated.It must be nice to know you can get the shots when you want to, and have the luxury to refuse and feel self-righteous about your decision. These people don’t realize how incredibly lucky they are.Charles SawyerPhoenix
