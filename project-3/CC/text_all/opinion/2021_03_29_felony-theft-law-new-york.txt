Too Many People Are Locked Up for Small Thefts
The United States has made some progress in reducing the shockingly large share of the population that lives behind bars, mostly by dialing back the War on Drugs. Building on this progress requires similar changes in the treatment of nonviolent property crime.In New York, as in many other states, stealing more than $1,000 is a felony. A person who grabs a new iPhone can end up in prison, at public expense, for four years.In New Jersey, which has the most stringent standard in the United States, a person can be convicted of a felony for stealing more than $200 — a number that hasn’t changed since 1978.Treating what amounts to petty theft as a felony is draconian. In American society, it is difficult to recover from a felony conviction. It is hard to find work, hard to find housing, hard to rebuild a life. Incarceration is also expensive and ineffective. New York spends about $60,000 per prisoner per year, but there is little evidence the punishment deters the crime.
