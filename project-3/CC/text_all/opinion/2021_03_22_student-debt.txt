Struggling With Mounting Student Debt
To the Editor:Re “Drowning in Student Loan Debt” (Op-Ed, March 19):It’s easy to sympathize with Molly Webster’s carrying tens of thousands of dollars in student debt at age 38. But she made the decisions to attend an expensive school, defer debt, attend graduate school full-time and study science journalism, a skill that garnered “just enough to keep the lights on.”If only more young people could come to know state colleges, part-time jobs during the school year and full-time jobs during the summer, majors like business administration and information technology, and evening schools for graduate work combined with well-paying day jobs. If only they knew that some employers will help out with grad school if the subject matter is related to the employee’s work. Maybe then there wouldn’t be so much talk about loan forgiveness.Mike EganPlymouth Meeting, Pa.To the Editor:I borrowed $75,000 to pay for college and now I owe $149,000. I’m paying a 7.5 to 8 percent interest rate. I have been making my payments on time, and, like Molly, I have federal loans.I don’t want to cancel debt; I want a reasonable fee assessed on what I borrowed. My loan would be nearly paid off by now if not for the exorbitant interest charged. Please help us!
