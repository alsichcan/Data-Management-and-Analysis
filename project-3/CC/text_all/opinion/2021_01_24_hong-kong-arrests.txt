Hong Kong Crackdown Is an Early Test for Biden
If the Biden administration was aiming to improve relations with China, events in the past few weeks have shown the depth of the chasm that has grown between Washington and Beijing in recent years on the most fundamental matters.This month, a thousand police officers armed with China’s tough new national security law fanned out across the semiautonomous city of Hong Kong and swept up dozens of opposition legislators, lawyers and activists.Days later, in one of his last moves as secretary of state, Mike Pompeo declared that China's policies against Muslims in its Xinjiang region constitute a “genocide” and “crimes against humanity.” Then, only minutes after President Biden took office, China announced sanctions against 28 departing and former Trump administration officials, including Mr. Pompeo.One last tit for tat — that may have been the intended message from Beijing. Or perhaps it was to signal that control over Hong Kong was nonnegotiable in post-Trump relations with the United States.
