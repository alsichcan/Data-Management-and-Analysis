Andrew Cuomo of New York faced a wave of calls for his resignation that began in the state legislature and crested with the support of some of the most powerful Democrats in Congress. “Due to the multiple, credible sexual harassment and misconduct allegations,” Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand said in a joint statement, “it is clear that Governor Cuomo has lost the confidence of his governing partners and the people of New York.”But the people of New York may beg to differ: A poll released on Monday found that while the governor’s favorability rating had indeed plummeted, only 35 percent of New York voters say that he should resign, and 50 percent say he should not.More than three years after the #MeToo movement started raising the nation’s consciousness about sexual harassment and assault, what explains the polarized reactions to the Cuomo allegations?
