Women of Bears Ears Are Asking You to Help Save It
We are among the Women of Bears Ears — Indigenous women who support our families and communities in the protections of ancestral lands. We come from Diné, Nuche, Pueblo and other allied Native Nations. From these Southwestern lands, twin buttes rise; they are known as Bears Ears.We have been birthed into these lands. The umbilical cords of our ancestors are buried here. Our genealogies are intertwined.
