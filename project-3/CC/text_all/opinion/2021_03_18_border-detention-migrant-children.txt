Migrant Children Deserve Better
Scarred by the sights and sounds of separated, frightened children crying for their parents from the cold, concrete floors of the frigid, cramped holding cells known as the hieleras of U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities at the border, America is eager to leave this shameful chapter in the past.Yet a sharp increase in the number of minors arriving at the border in recent weeks has left more than 4,000 children in Border Patrol holding cells again, many for longer than legally allowed. Roughly 8,500 more children are being housed in shelters as they wait to be placed with relatives or vetted sponsors.The Biden administration has vowed to honor the hope and promise that drives so many to Americaâ€™s border seeking refuge. But keeping this promise will require a departure from past policy that has relied on holding migrant children in custody. The government cannot simply design a new facility with prettier window dressings and a bigger playground, or any detention facility designed to hold an overflow of people. We need to treat minors not as threats, but as children.Many families arriving at the border today are denied the forms of relief and opportunity that my own family experienced. When I was 10 years old, we fled El Salvador as the brutal civil war ravaged our home country. We were initially denied political asylum, but we were lucky to have arrived at the right time. Thanks to the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which strengthened immigration enforcement with legalization provisions for unauthorized immigrants, we petitioned and were granted permanent resident status. Nowadays, families like mine are denied entry altogether or are torn apart.
