Getting the I.R.S. to Crack Down on Tax Cheats
To the Editor:Re “How to Collect Unpaid Taxes” (editorial, March 21):Your editorial on the burgeoning federal unpaid tax debt hit the right points. The Collection Division and the Examination Division of the Internal Revenue Service have been understaffed and underfunded for decades. Programs like Offer in Compromise (a settlement option for taxpayers) and Criminal Investigation for tax fraud were on the ropes before Covid-19, and the past year may have put the final nail in the coffin of a functioning tax administration system.Most frontline collection and examination employees are working remotely, eliminating the ability to have the face-to-face contact with delinquent taxpayers. Over 24 million tax returns from 2019 and 2020 have not been processed. The three stimulus distributions were the responsibility of the I.R.S., without any thought to the impact on other already struggling programs.Money is thrown in many directions by the federal government. It is past time to throw needed resources to the Internal Revenue Service.William RedmondLexington, Ky.The writer, a tax consultant, is a former I.R.S. revenue officer.To the Editor:Leona Helmsley famously said “only the little people pay taxes.” More recently, Donald Trump made it clear to all Americans that paying taxes was unnecessary for wealthy individuals and businesses, by slashing taxes on the rich and corporations, and through his personal example of manipulating his own returns to avoid paying taxes.
