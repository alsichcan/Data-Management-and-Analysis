No, the Chaos in America Is Not a Gift to China and Russia
Is the political disarray in the United States really “a godsend for America’s critics” or a “propaganda coup” for them? Is Chris Coons, a Democratic senator from Delaware, correct to warn that the crisis of American democracy “feeds into the playbooks of authoritarian leaders around the world?”Hua Chunying, the spokeswoman of China’s Foreign Ministry, for one, has called out some U.S. officials and politicians for describing protesters in Hong Kong as “democracy heroes” but saying that the Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol last week were “thugs” and “extremists.”Russia’s first deputy ambassador to the United Nations, Dmitry Polyanskiy, denounced on Twitter the fact that protesters who entered the Capitol “Maidan-style” — referring to the 2014 uprisings in Ukraine, which garnered much support in the West — were being described as “criminals.”The spokeswoman for Russia’s Foreign Ministry, Maria Zakharova, has argued that the event “has once again brought our attention to the archaic electoral system of the United States.”
