President Biden, Thousands of Refugees Are Waiting On You
When President Biden took the oath of office, refugees in the U.S. resettlement pipeline felt they finally had some good news. Our client Faida, who fled persecution in the Democratic Republic of Congo, was six months pregnant when she received word that she had met the legal requirements and cleared all background, security and medical checks, and would be allowed to resettle in the United States. She even had a plane ticket and was counting the days until she would be in her new home in Pittsburgh, reunited with family and friends.But President Biden waited too long to sign the documents to restart the refugee program. Faida’s travel date came and went. In the meantime, Faida’s baby was born — a healthy boy who now needs to obtain his own documents in order to be resettled. Like everything in refugee resettlement, this will take time. Meanwhile, Faida continues to wait in an East African refugee camp.She isn’t alone. More than 715 approved and vetted refugees had their travel plans canceled before President Biden finally acted to revise the refugee cap for 2021 on May 3, raising the number of refugees the United States would admit to 62,500 from the historic low of 15,000 set by his predecessor. Over the 40-year history of the U.S. refugee resettlement program, average annual admissions targets were 95,000 per year before plummeting under President Donald Trump.At a time when the number of displaced people worldwide is the highest it’s ever been, we are relieved that President Biden has committed to welcoming more refugees to the United States this year.
