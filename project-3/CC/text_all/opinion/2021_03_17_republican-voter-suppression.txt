Poverty as a Proxy for Race in Voter Suppression
You just can’t be racist the way you used to.Monumental legal cases invoking the 14th Amendment, the “equal justice” amendment, have made it unconstitutional to use blunt, explicit racism to suppress and victimize Black people while elevating and advantaging white ones.To achieve those nefarious ends today, politicians must use a sneakier, less direct mechanism. And very often, that mechanism is to place burdens on the poorest citizens, knowing that poverty heavily afflicts — and can serve as a proxy for — Black people.That is exactly what is happening now as Republicans, still fuming about the loss of the White House and the Senate, rush to make it harder for people to vote — many of them Black and brown people.There are two ways to win an election: convince enough voters that you are best suited for the job, or rid the electorate of as many people who would vote against you as possible.
