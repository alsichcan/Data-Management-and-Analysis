Introducing ‘The Argument’ With Jane Coaston
There are all kinds of arguments, many of them pretty unproductive. Either nobody listens, or nobody wins, or you go around in circles, or you bring up old baggage that should’ve stayed in storage.But the best arguments, and the ones I like to have, are the ones that make me think differently. They help inform my opinions, or challenge them. And they help me understand the people who have other points of view.Starting Feb. 24, I’ll be the new host of “The Argument.” There’s no new episode this week, but right now, you can hear a preview of the new version of the show by clicking the play button. Every week, people who disagree with one another will come together on the podcast to hash it out.I’ve reported for years on conservatism and the American right. I’ve talked to people from all points on the political spectrum, and I’ve heard a lot of “the other side doesn’t get it,” and “the other side is evil.”
