Why Are We Worrying About Women’s Work?
It seems politicians do sometimes keep their promises. President Biden campaigned on a pledge of newfound political consensus, and he has delivered on one point, at least, even if it is not one he might have expected: Commenters on the right and left are concerned that the child tax credit in the American Rescue Plan Act — up to $3,600 for children 5 and under, and up to $3,000 for kids 6 to 17 — will discourage women from working outside the home.Spirited debate over women working outside the home might feel like an artifact of the 1970s, when feminists struggled for American women’s right to participate in the labor market and conservatives claimed that would destroy the American family. (Never mind that poor women, especially single poor women, have always worked outside the home.) In that era, women’s rights activists fought to overcome both cultural and legal barriers to work. They won that battle decisively. In 1978, for instance, Congress barred companies with 15 or more employees from firing women who became pregnant. By the 1990s, most women had joined the labor force, and as of 2019, roughly 70 percent of married mothers worked outside the home.And so I was reasonably convinced — naïvely, it now seems — that the question of whether women ought to work outside the home had been either rendered irrelevant by history or settled along the lines of “work if you want to, don’t if you don’t.”But arguments over principle often find new life when government spending is involved, and so it is with women in the work force and the child benefit coming to families this year.
