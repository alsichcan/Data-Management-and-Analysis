Biden’s Efforts to Reduce Gun Violence
To the Editor:Re “Biden Moves to Curb Plague of Gun Crime” (front page, April 9):President Biden said, “Gun violence in this country is an epidemic.” Twice. It is.Coverage of the Covid epidemic has been massive: daily articles and graphics, death rate figures, quotes from prominent people, etc. What’s the moving seven-day average of shootings? What’s the death rate for daily gun violence? Which states have legislated to contain this epidemic?Why does one major epidemic merit such enormous space and another so much less? How many lives could you save through continual public awareness with a daily drumbeat of even half the coverage given to Covid?John KrausserSeattleTo the Editor:President Biden announced that one area the Justice Department will focus on is providing a model law for so-called red flag orders, a.k.a. extreme risk protection orders, or ERPOs. There is a patchwork of such laws in the 19 states and Washington, D.C. These variously give the police, and in many states family members, legal standing to petition a court to remove guns from owners who are at significant risk for suicide, homicide or accidents via guns. Of the 19, just three give legal standing to health care professionals: Washington, D.C., Maryland and Hawaii.Physicians and other health personnel are often faced with quandaries about patients who are at high risk for gun tragedy. They are stymied by HIPAA requirements that breaching confidentiality requires a “serious and imminent risk.” The Department of Health and Human Services has proposed a more workable standard: “serious and reasonably foreseeable.”
