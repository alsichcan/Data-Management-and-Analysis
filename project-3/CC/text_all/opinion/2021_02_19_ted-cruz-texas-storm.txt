Ted Cruz Fled One Storm, but Flew Into Another
To the Editor:Re “Bolting to Cancún, Cruz Finds More Heat Than He Expected” (front page, Feb. 19):In a time of despair and suffering in Texas because of extreme winter weather, the population is enduring power outages, a lack of basic necessities, and fragile infrastructure. With such arduous times, it is only natural to look to the leaders the people elected for comfort and relief.Senator Ted Cruz provided comfort and relief, not to the Texans he represents, of course, but to himself and his family. His selfish decision to flee the country to Mexico truly illuminates how out of touch with reality Mr. Cruz is. The lack of concern for his constituents and his state clearly highlights his self-centered mind-set.As more people begin to see the true nature of some politicians, we the people are left with a question: Do we believe that it is right for a public servant to leave his constituents behind to travel to another country for refuge? This answer will serve as a precedent for the future of this country.Jaisnav RajeshNaperville, Ill.To the Editor:Congratulations to Ted Cruz for setting such a great example in good citizenship and compassion for his young daughters by heading to the beach in Cancún, while their fellow Texans froze in the dark. What a man. What a dad.
