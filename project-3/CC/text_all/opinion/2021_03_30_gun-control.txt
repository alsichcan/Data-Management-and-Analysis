A Better Term Than ‘Gun Control’?
To the Editor:Re “Stop It With ‘Gun Control.’ Enough Already” (column, March 28):Frank Bruni is right that the phrase “gun control” is incendiary, unnecessarily getting in the way of the kind of common-sense gun policies that could attract broad bipartisan support. The phrase he is searching for is “responsible gun ownership.” This phrase recognizes that gun ownership will remain a feature of American life for the foreseeable future and emphasizes the necessity of responsibility, a key virtue in a republic.Living in Vermont, a state where many people own guns and use them safely, I often say that we need gun regulations designed by Vermont hunters and sportsmen. With its positive assertion of the right to own guns, I am sure you could get a majority of them behind the phrase “responsible gun ownership.”Al ZaccorBridport, Vt.To the Editor:The expression Frank Bruni is searching for is “weapon management.”As a United Nations disarmament expert in Afghanistan, I learned that “gun control” proved unrealistic in that country, where, as the Afghans like to say, “Women wear jewelry, men wear guns.”We moved from “disarmament” into “management,” which meant registration of legal firearms, verification of an owner’s good reputation, checks on safe ammunition storage, etc. “Weapon management” is something every American should be able to understand and approve.
