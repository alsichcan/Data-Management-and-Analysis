George Floyd and the Seeds of a New Kind of Activism
ST. LOUIS — Last year, the world watched for nine minutes and 29 seconds as a video showed the final moments of George Floyd’s life. We all heard Mr. Floyd plead with the police as he gasped for enough air to repeat the words “I can’t breathe” more than 20 times. In the weeks that followed his death, as many as 26 million people took to the streets in defense of Black lives.For those of us in St. Louis, this moment felt gruesomely familiar. Just five days before George Floyd’s murder on May 25, 2020, Michael Brown would have celebrated his 24th birthday. On Aug. 9, 2014, Mr. Brown was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson — spurring protests and a movement to build a world where Black lives matter. The Ferguson uprising brought a new generation into the work of fighting for transformation in our communities.What we have learned in the nearly seven years since Mike Brown was killed is that the uprising is just the beginning.Maya Angelou taught us, “Do the best you can until you know better. Then when you know better, do better.” Like many organizers and advocates across the country, our work has continued to evolve as we strive to know better. This movement, spurred by the daily devaluation of Black lives and punctuated by brutal police killings, has matured beyond calls for “reform.” In St. Louis, following the uprising, our demands included elements like implicit bias training and body cameras, and shined a spotlight on obvious abuses, like racist fines and fees. But tepid reforms have failed us repeatedly. Our vision is now one of defunding police departments and abolishing the carceral system, as we push ourselves and others to imagine a society that is truly rooted in principles of justice, love and liberation.
