An Early Fascination With Caves Leads to a World Stage
Kabage Karanja had one of his earliest and most profound experiences when, as a teenage member of Hodari Boys, a youth mentoring club, he camped in the Suswa Caves, northwest of Nairobi, Kenya.It was a special memory for Mr. Karanja, now an architect, partly because “I remember waking up in the middle of the night,” he said, “and there was a Maasai warrior just standing there, watching us sleep.”He was also fascinated by the idea that humans’ first forays into architecture happened in caves, so when he, Stella Mutegi and Balmoi Abe (who has since left their partnership) started their own firm, they named it Cave_Bureau.This week Cave_Bureau will become the first Kenyan firm to make its debut at the Venice Architecture Biennale with the exhibition “Obsidian Rain” in the central pavilion.
