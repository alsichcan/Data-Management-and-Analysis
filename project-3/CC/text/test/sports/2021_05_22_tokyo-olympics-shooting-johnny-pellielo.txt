Tales of his visit to the Vatican, where the pope reassured him that his devotion to shooting and to his religious beliefs could coexist, and of the time he went to a prison in Sicily and a convicted killer praised his shooting accuracy.Pellielo tells the stories in an interview in the office of his shooting range, surrounded by photos of him taken around the world, medals around his neck. This summer, Pellielo, who is known as Johnny, hopes he will have a new one, about competing in his eighth Olympic Games at age 51.Many athletes are inspired by coaches, by parents and even by God.
