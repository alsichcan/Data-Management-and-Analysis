‘Absolutely Yes’: Games Will Go On Even in State of Emergency, I.O.C. Says
TOKYO — The rescheduled 2020 Olympics will go on even if a state of emergency is declared in the city this summer, a top Olympics official said Friday, dismissing once again the suggestion that the coronavirus pandemic might force a postponement or cancellation of a global sports showcase that has already been delayed a year.“We have successfully seen five sports hold test events during a state of emergency,” said John Coates, a vice president of the International Olympic Committee, during a news conference at the end of a three-day virtual meeting to address preparations. “All of the plans to protect safety and security of athletes are based around worst possible circumstances. So the answer is absolutely yes.”Polls in Japan have shown that a significant majority of citizens would prefer another postponement or cancellation altogether of the Games, which are scheduled to open July 23 — nine weeks to the day from Friday — and run into early August.In a letter sent Friday to national Olympic committees, athletes, broadcasters and others, Coates, who serves as the chairman of the I.O.C.’s coordination commission for Tokyo, said the organization was now “very delivery-focused.”
