‘New Order’ Review: A Revolutionary Nightmare or a Recurring Dream?
The Mexican filmmaker Michel Franco frequently devises narrative puzzles that hinge on unusual and emotionally fraught moral and ethical dilemmas. They’re usually on an intimate scale, as in his 2016 medical drama “Chronic.” His latest film, “New Order,” which created a sensation at home and on the festival circuit, takes a contained approach to a big event: insurrection.An opening montage, featuring many shots that will recur throughout the narrative, is practically surreal, flashing images of destruction and splatters of green liquid. The movie settles in on a lavish Mexico City home where family and friends are celebrating the coming wedding of Marianne (Naian González Norvind). As she and her moneyed fiancé frolic with the guests, disturbances from the outside start oozing in.
