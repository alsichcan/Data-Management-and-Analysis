‘Seance’ Review: Summoning Trouble with Lipstick and Latin
When a group of mean girls invite Camille (Suki Waterhouse), the protagonist of “Seance,” to contact a dead classmate, she shrugs.“Why not?” Camille says. “Sounds weird.”That is essentially the thesis of this genre-confused film: Why not? Sounds weird.“Seance,” directed by Simon Barrett, takes place at the fictional Edelvine Academy, an all-girls boarding school where an evil presence emerges after a clique of students tries to summon a ghost. Newcomer Camille arrives just as girls are beginning to disappear.
