‘Into the Darkness’ Review: Making Excuses for Collaboration
“Into the Darkness” follows an industrialist’s family in early-1940s Denmark as its members rationalize their complicity with the occupying Nazis. Through politeness and denial, they variously decide aiding fugitives is too risky, that demonstrations are irresponsible, that they’re less pro-Nazi than anti-Communist and that doing business with the Germans is acceptable if it keeps the factory open. Also, while it’s distasteful that a German naval commander has designs on the industrialist’s daughter (he gives her a U-boat pin with a swastika on it), he’s not necessarily a party member. Right?
