Climate Change Is Worsening. So the Weather Station Is Singing About It.
Some musicians are compelled to write a song after a lovers’ quarrel, an encounter with a great work of art or a particularly resonant overheard exchange. Tamara Lindeman, the 36-year-old Canadian singer and songwriter who records under the name the Weather Station, was recently driven to write one immediately after reading an article about the oil and gas corporation Exxon Mobil.“When I say that, it sounds very esoteric or political or strange, but it’s very personal to me,” she said on a video call from her Toronto home one Monday morning in January, her sandy-blond bangs hanging as long as the fringe on her brown suede jacket. Call the songs on her piercing record “Ignorance,” due Feb. 5, anthems of ambivalence: Lindeman wrote most of them over what she calls “a weird winter where I was obsessively reading about climate change” and enamored of a particular toy keyboard with a built-in drum machine.Around that time, she also began attending Fridays for Future demonstrations in Toronto and hosting a series called Elephant in the Room, for which she interviewed other musicians and activists about climate change.“Her eyes are open,” said Ben Whiteley, who has played bass on her records and in her touring band since 2017. “She’s an incredibly nuanced thinker, very aware of the human emotional state. So she was like, ‘We need to address the emotional side of climate change.’”
