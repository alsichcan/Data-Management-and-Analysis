The World Grieves for Millions. An Artist Grieves for One.
We are facing a special challenge in the pandemic era: How do we mourn death at the scale we are witnessing it? In a new exhibition, the Canadian artist Divya Mehra offers a surprising and timely suggestion: big fat emojis.“The funny things You do” at Night Gallery in Los Angeles (through March 13), includes just one work, but it’s a whopper: Nearly 20-foot-tall inflatable versions of the wave and urn emojis, expressive of a “tsunami of grief”; when the exhibition opened in mid-January, two million had died from the coronavirus.The mind balks at that number but the show’s evocation of devastation deals partly with Mehra’s mourning of one: her father, Kamal, who died in 2015. He founded Winnipeg’s first North Indian restaurant in the 1970s; it remains a fixture there. The artist, 39, was reticent to talk about him in an otherwise wide-ranging two-hour Zoom conversation from her home there. But she did say, “Those two emojis have taken up so much space for me over the past few years.”
