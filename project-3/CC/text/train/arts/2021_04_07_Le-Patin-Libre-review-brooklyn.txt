Review: The Brooklyn Academy Dips a Toe Back in With Live Skating
It was strange enough to be watching a performance in person. Try being in a park at twilight and sitting on the same stage as the performers: a sheet of ice. The audience’s portion of the rink was covered, but there was still a bracing breeze — despite the mild April night — right around the ankles.On Tuesday, the Brooklyn Academy of Music presented its first live performance in more than a year with Le Patin Libre (“free skate” in French), a contemporary skating company from Montreal. The performance, at LeFrak Center at Lakeside in Prospect Park, even brought out Mayor Bill de Blasio who, in a speech before the performance, said that “when the cultural community comes back, all things are possible.”That’s probably because culture is usually one of the last things to come back, but oh well — it has been a long year. It was nice to see bodies moving in space. And skating represents something bigger than a blade and a body: It’s the idea of soaring, of flying, of resisting gravity. By nature, skating is an uplifting act and art.
