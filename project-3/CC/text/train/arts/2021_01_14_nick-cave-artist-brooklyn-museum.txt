Call It Sign or Art, a Disputed Nick Cave Work Is Moving to Brooklyn
The Brooklyn Museum thinks it can handle the truth.This spring, it will be installing Nick Cave’s artwork “Truth Be Told” (2020) on the outdoor plaza near its entrance, in conjunction with an exhibition beginning May 14 that will feature contemporary work in the collection by some 60 artists.“Truth Be Told” — three words in black vinyl that currently stretch some 160 feet across the facade of an outpost of Jack Shainman’s New York gallery called the School — has generated months of controversy in the Hudson Valley village of Kinderhook, N.Y.Mr. Cave conceived the work to address issues of racial injustice in the wake of the killing of George Floyd, who died in Minneapolis police custody last spring.The village says the text work is a sign, and hence violates local code and should be taken down. But Mr. Cave and his dealer, Jack Shainman, say it’s an artwork allowed by their special use permit, and they haven’t budged since it went up at the end of October.
