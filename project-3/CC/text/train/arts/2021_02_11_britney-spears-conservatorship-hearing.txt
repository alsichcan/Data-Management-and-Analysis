Control of Britney Spears’s Estate Debated at Court Hearing
Following a week of swirling social media chatter, fan speculation and critical re-evaluation surrounding the life and music career of Britney Spears, the legal battle over her personal well-being and finances continued on Thursday in a brief, staid court hearing that focused on the minutiae of estate management, legal representation and scheduling.Despite the fanfare around the case, it was business as usual in a Los Angeles courthouse as the judge, Brenda Penny, did not order any substantial changes to the conservatorship that has overseen much of Spears’s existence since 2008.The singer, 39, was the subject of a new documentary by The New York Times, “Framing Britney Spears,” that premiered last week and led to renewed conversation around the case. In addition to tracing the singer’s career as a child star and teenage pop sensation, the film focused on recent attempts by Spears, through a court-appointed lawyer, to have her father removed from the conservatorship — a complex legal arrangement typically used for the very ill, old or infirm — that he has helped steer for more than a decade.
