On London’s Reopened Ballet Stages, a Focus on the Contemporary
LONDON — The mood was ebullient on Tuesday night at the Royal Opera House, as the audience settled in for the first performance by the Royal Ballet in almost six months, a day after theaters and museums were officially allowed to open in England. The disembodied voice asking people to turn off their cellphones got rousing applause before the lights went down for the evening’s program, “21st Century Choreographers,” a mixed bill that included a new work by Kyle Abraham, his first for the Royal Ballet.Abraham, one of the few Black choreographers to be commissioned by the Royal Ballet, has shown his wide-ranging curiosity about working in different modes and tones over the last few years. His new dance, “Optional Family: A Divertissement,” is entirely unlike his work for his own company, A.I.M., or his two pieces for the New York City Ballet — the inventive, glamorous “The Runaway” (2018) or the recent spare and serene “When We Fell,” a filmed dance.He is right to call “Optional Family” a divertissement: The 10-minute work for three dancers is amusing, well crafted and intriguing. But it also feels incomplete, like an idea for something bigger. (Perhaps it is; he has been commissioned to create an ensemble work for the Royal Ballet in spring 2022.)
