On ‘I Hate Suzie,’ Sexual Freedom Is a Fantasy

Or, rather, she tries to masturbate, but the act isn’t easy; it’s a labor of equal parts determination and frustration, like a frequently benched player hobbling onto the field, already lost.The episode spends most of its time in Suzie’s head as she twists in bed in her blue leopard-print pajama set, guiding us through her horny dreamscape. It’s a novel place to be, one rarely shown on TV programs. But “I Hate Suzie” was just one of several series in the last year — two others were “I May Destroy You” and “Sex Education” — to examine female desire and conclude that it can never exist in a vacuum; even when it exists in the privacy of the imagination, it is still subject to the intrusion of social norms and expectations.But such shows reveal more than the symbiotic relationship between female desire and societally sanctioned shame — they show how sex and sexuality are forever tied to female identity and self-image. “I Hate Suzie,” “I May Destroy You” and “Sex Education” know that female sexuality is a trap: We live in a world that simultaneously objectifies and exploits female desire while trying to pretend it doesn’t exist. Society tells us there is no right way to be a woman, but countless wrong ways.
