An Artist Who Is Always Heading for Home
In January 2020, an M.T.A. bus driver named Tyrone Hampton found a nonverbal child still sitting onboard at the end of a run in Upper Manhattan. He called for help and watched over the boy until he knew he’d get safely home.It was a small news story, with a happy ending. But it was the kind of incident that touches Azikiwe Mohammed, 37, an artist who, through different media — painting, textiles, performative installations — is interested in constructing spaces of safety and welcome for people of color and for immigrants whose space is often threatened.“I have a bunch of alerts set for when people don’t make it home,” Mohammed said in an interview at the Yeh Art Gallery at St. John’s University in Jamaica, Queens, where the first exhibition devoted to his textile-based art is concluding soon. One of the 40 pieces in the show is a tribute to Hampton, whose portrait he has stitched onto a vintage denim jacket.It is just another entry in Mohammed’s visual universe, a realm devoted to everyday heroes and small acts of care.
