Director of SFMOMA Steps Down
After nearly 20 years at the helm, the director of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, Neal Benezra, is stepping down, the museum announced on Tuesday.Benezra, 67, said he was leaving because “19 years is a long time, and the time feels right to begin our succession planning.”“What we are announcing is the beginning of a transition,” he added, “not a departure.”But his decision comes at a challenging moment in the 86-year history of the museum, which Benezra helped expand into one of the largest contemporary art institutions in the country.Over the last year, SFMOMA has had to reckon with what employees have called structural inequities around race. Its senior, and longest-serving curator, Gary Garrels, resigned over comments he had made in a meeting that some considered racist. And Benezra had to apologize to employees after limiting comments on a former staffer’s Instagram feed.
