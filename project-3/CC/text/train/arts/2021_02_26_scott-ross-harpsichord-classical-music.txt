He Was a ‘Bad Boy’ Harpsichordist, and the Best of His Age
Nicolas Bomsel was a radio producer in Paris when he had lunch with Scott Ross early in 1984.Ross, then in his early 30s, was already one of the most eminent harpsichord players in Europe. He had burst onto the scene in 1971 with a rarely awarded first prize at the prestigious Bruges competition, then released a series of sprawling, sparkling recordings of French Baroque music: a four-LP Rameau set in 1975, 11 hours of Couperin a few years later.A moody, troubled, brilliant American who had moved to France as a boy, Ross dressed for classes and even concerts sometimes in leather jacket and jeans, sometimes in lumberjack-plaid flannel. His clothes jarred with the buttoned-up reputation of his instrument, a courtly ancestor of the modern piano that sounded tinny and harsh under many hands, but silky, lush and bright in his.The refined poise of his playing was ever at odds with his provocative persona, his delight in shocking friends with vulgar, outrageous conversational turns. “He was early music’s bad boy,” the conductor William Christie, who knew Ross when they were both young expatriate harpsichordists, said in an interview.But Ross’s antics didn’t alienate him from supporters who recognized a rare virtuoso. By the time of that lunch in Paris, he was securing a relationship with Erato, the influential record label, and Bomsel asked what he planned to do with it, what his dream projects might be. The answer was stunning: Ross wanted to record the complete keyboard sonatas of Domenico Scarlatti.
