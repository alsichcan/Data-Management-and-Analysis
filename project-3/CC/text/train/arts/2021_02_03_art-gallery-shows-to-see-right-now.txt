Art Gallery Shows to See Right Now
New York City art galleries form a resilient and irrepressible ecosystem, one that has survived recessions, gentrification, at least one hurricane, and now an aggressive pandemic. Through everything, the system continues to sprout new life. The group show “Downtown 2021,” curated by the artist Sam Gordon, pays homage to this phenomenon by giving more than two dozen galleries their hardscrabble props.The show’s title is adapted from Edo Bertoglio’s “Downtown 81,” a film about the 1980s art-and-club scene in the East Village, La MaMa Galleria’s longtime neighborhood. But as surveyed by Gordon, “downtown” is expansive terrain, encompassing not just Manhattan but also Brooklyn and Queens. More than that, the word describes an attitude, one that blends a pull toward independence with a commitment to community.
