The Met Changes Course
If not for the tumultuous events of 2020, “Inside the Met,” a three-part documentary about the Metropolitan Museum of Art airing on PBS May 21 and 28 might simply be a routine valentine to a great institution in the 150th year of its existence.But things did not go as planned. Thanks to the coronavirus and the mass protests following George Floyd’s killing, the Met, like much of New York’s cultural world, faced an accounting unlike any in its history. Luckily, the British documentary filmmaker Ian Denyer and his crew were there to capture some of it on film — if often in suitably flattering terms. But as the series unfolds — passing through sleepy patches and enthralling encounters with artworks, the professionals who tend them and the visitors who throng to see them — you may begin to feel that the flattery is ultimately deserved.Denyer’s work usually has a cultural tilt. Previous subjects include William Blake, P.G. Wodehouse, the British artist Ryan Gander and Chinese porcelains. “Inside the Met” was conceived to chronicle the celebration of the 150th anniversary of the museum’s incorporation in 1870.
