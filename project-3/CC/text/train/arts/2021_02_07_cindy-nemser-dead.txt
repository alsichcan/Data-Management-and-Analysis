Cindy Nemser, Advocate for Women Artists, Is Dead at 83
Cindy Nemser, an art critic and historian who, half a century ago, began calling out sexism in the art world, decrying the way women artists were treated and how their work was evaluated, died on Jan. 26 at her home in Brooklyn. She was 83.Her daughter, Catherine Nemser, said the cause was pneumonia.Ms. Nemser was already writing for arts publications in 1969 when someone invited her to an early meeting of Women Artists in Revolution, a New York coalition that pushed back against the marginalization of women in the art world. At the time few women had gallery representation or were being shown in major museums.“A visit with that group changed my life,” Ms. Nemser recounted in an autobiographical essay. “I became an avid feminist,” determined to help erase stereotypes about women artists and raise their status.Toward that end, in 1972 she and Patricia Mainardi founded The Feminist Art Journal, which for the next five years published essays, interviews, historical research and more aimed at correcting the imbalance. The magazine was fearless about spotlighting chauvinism, often naming names, and about excavating its underlying presumptions, as Ms. Nemser did in an essay published in April 1972.
