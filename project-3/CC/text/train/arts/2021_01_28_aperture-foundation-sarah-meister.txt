MoMA Photography Curator to Lead Aperture Foundation
Sarah Meister has been named executive director of the Aperture Foundation, a nonprofit organization that supports and promotes the art of photography.Meister, 49, is a photography curator at the Museum of Modern Art, where she has spent her entire career. She succeeds Chris Boot, who is leaving after 10 years to return to his native England.Aperture publishes photography books and a quarterly magazine, maintains a website, and sponsors talks and exhibitions. It operated a public program space in Chelsea until shortly before the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. One of the challenges facing the new executive director is the purchase or lease of new headquarters.Founded in 1952 in San Francisco by an illustrious group that included Minor White, Ansel Adams and Dorothea Lange, Aperture has issued important monographic books by a number of photographers, including Diane Arbus, LaToya Ruby Frazier, Nan Goldin, Richard Misrach and Deana Lawson. “Aperture’s publishing program, meaning their books and magazine, are central to anyone thinking about photography today,” Meister said in a phone interview this week. “My whole career, I’ve been interested in the edges of photography. Aperture has demonstrated a deep commitment to this plurality from the start — who has been excluded, and who is saying who is in and who is out. I don’t believe photography exists in isolation, from life or from art.”
