Prompted by the Pandemic, Opera Philadelphia Innovates Online
What can an opera company actually do in a pandemic? Yes, some previously planned performances can be turned into livestreams, and broadcasts of past stagings can be made freely available — if only to remind the public what it’s missing.But where some companies might be resigned to only that, Opera Philadelphia pluckily spent 2020 commissioning new work and launching its own streaming service. OperaPhila.tv, which debuted in October and is available as an app for major streaming devices, so far features just one vintage broadcast: an engaging 2015 production of Verdi’s “La Traviata,” featuring a then-rising soprano Lisette Oropesa. Everything else, including a new version of David T. Little’s “Soldier Songs” that premieres on Friday, has been produced during the pandemic. (Subscriptions for the season, which continues through May 31, cost $99, though individual titles are available to rent.)Compared with other American companies, Opera Philadelphia is laying claim to the mantle of making new material during the pandemic. (The Metropolitan Opera, for example, maintains a vast digital library of past performances, but is postponing any premieres until next season.) Still, what’s most notable about OperaPhila.tv is not its mere existence, but the strength of the work on offer. It debuted with a stirring, pretaped recital headlined by the tenor Lawrence Brownlee, and shortly thereafter added another searing performance — also starring Brownlee — of Tyshawn Sorey’s “Cycles of My Being,” a work first presented by the company in 2018.
