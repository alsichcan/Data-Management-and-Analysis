‘Worn Stories’ Treats Clothing as the Fabric of Memory. I Can Relate.
For Joe, it’s the Air Jordan hoodie that belonged to his son, Jeremy, cut down by a lethal heroin overdose. For the writer and stylist Simon Doonan, it’s a pair of Lycra Stephen Sprouse leggings, worn through sweaty aerobics classes to cope as one friend after another died of AIDS. For Michael, it’s the patchwork quilt sewed by his mom, Debbie, while she was in prison.We tend to think of clothing as fashion or utility, something to show off or stay warm in. But it’s so much more than that, as we’re reminded in “Worn Stories,” the new Netflix series, which debuted last week, about the clothes we wear and the stories they tell. Based on the books “Worn Stories” and “Worn in New York,” both by Emily Spivack, the series presents a collection of sartorial autobiographies, personal stories of chance, identity, survival, community and life, all related to the fabric we put on our bodies every day.“Clothing carries so much memory,” said Spivack, who is an executive producer of the series, in a phone interview last month. “It’s so tactile, and it really absorbs experiences. It plays a significant role in reminding us of the people who we care about.”
