June Newton, Photographer and Muse, Dies at 97
June Newton, the widow, muse and collaborator of Helmut Newton, the fashion photographer and provocateur known as “the King of Kink” for his erotically charged tableaux of Amazonian women — and, under the name Alice Springs, a photographer in her own right — died on April 9 at a hospital in Monte Carlo. She was 97.Her agent, Tiggy Maconochie, announced the death.While Mr. Newton’s Berlin noir images were carefully constructed mise-en-scènes depicting sex work or bondage or some other dark fantasy — like the notorious photograph of the model and creative director Jenny Capitain posed in a German pension, naked save for a neck brace and a cast — Ms. Newton’s pictures were unmediated and intimate. Charlotte Rampling’s sharp eyes stare you down in a portrait from 1982; a young and beautiful Robert Mapplethorpe, shot in 1977, looks as if he would live forever; Graham Greene is quizzical and pensive in a photo from 1988. (She later recalled that meeting her literary hero had made her a nervous wreck.) Brigitte Nielsen brandishes her son like a trophy, from a series of mothers and their babies — the subjects drawn from the Newtons’ glittering social circle of models and actors, designers and European royalty.
