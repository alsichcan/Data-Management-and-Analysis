Virus Cases Delay Effort to Bring Indoor Dance Back to New York
It was one of the most high-profile experiments to bring indoor live performance back to New York City.The Park Avenue Armory decided to take advantage of the cavernous, flexible space of its 55,000-square-foot Drill Hall to hold a short season called “Social Distance Hall.” It received permission from state health authorities to invite extremely limited audiences back inside, and planned to give them all rapid tests for the coronavirus. To kick things off, it turned to one of the great choreographers of the day, Bill T. Jones, to stage “Afterwardsness,” a new piece that addresses the coronavirus pandemic and violence against Black people.But the eagerly anticipated performances, which were set to begin on Wednesday for a sold-out seven-day run, had to be postponed after several members of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Company tested positive for the virus, Rebecca Robertson, the president and executive producer of the Armory, said on Saturday in an email to ticket holders.“The affected performers are, thank heavens, feeling well,” Robertson wrote.“While this is greatly disappointing for the artists, the Armory and our audiences, this postponement is a necessary part of the process of collectively returning to in-person performances in responsible and safe ways,” she added.
