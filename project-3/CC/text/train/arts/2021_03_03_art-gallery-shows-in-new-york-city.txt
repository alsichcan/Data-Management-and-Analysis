Art Gallery Shows to See Right Now
Over many decades, the Studio Museum in Harlem’s annual artist in residence exhibitions have been events of unfailing interest, with most in recent years showcasing three up-and-coming young artists, among them some of the very best we have. This year’s edition sustains the winning streak, even in an unusual location: While the museum’s new David Adjaye-designed building is under construction in Harlem, the current show is (as it was last year) at MoMA PS1 in Long Island City, Queens.According to an exhibition essay, the “longing vessel” of the title is, basically, the Black body. And while this year’s three artists might be seen as at least tangentially connected to a current, heavily marketed trend in Black portraiture, they expand on and complicate the figurative tradition in refreshing ways.In large-scale paintings done in lush, citrusy colors, Naudline Pierre sets her own image in a mystical realm of winged female beings — angels, ancestors — caught up in scenes of conflict and mutual protection. In the culturally syncretic rainbow-hued universe she creates, the poet of liberation William Blake, the mythmaking Black painter Bob Thompson, and religious artists of many places and persuasions would feel equally at home.
