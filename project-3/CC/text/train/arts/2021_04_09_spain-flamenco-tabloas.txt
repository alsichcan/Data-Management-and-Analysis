They’re Sacred Spaces for Spain’s Flamenco Scene. Many Won’t Survive Covid.
MADRID — They’re often in darkened, cavelike spaces, with a stage nestled among patrons’ tables and chairs. These small clubs, called tablaos, have acted as a springboard for generations of flamenco artists in Spain to launch professional careers, much in the way that many jazz musicians first came to the public’s attention in the clubs of cities like New Orleans.But that intimate setup, designed to pack the audience close to the stage, has left most tablaos unable to reopen even after Spain lifted its most severe pandemic lockdown restrictions last summer. The situation has created an existential struggle for these cherished institutions at the heart of a national art form.Juan Manuel del Rey, the president of the national association of tablaos, said that if the government didn’t step in with more financial support, “We are now heading for extinction.”“You cannot function economically when you have almost more employees and artists than spectators,” he said.
