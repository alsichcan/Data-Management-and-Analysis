The Union Moved. The Beloved Mosaic Mural Couldn’t.
Not far from Times Square I walked west from Eighth Avenue on a recent afternoon to view a mural I had noticed on several occasions but never truly paused to appreciate.This artwork, mounted on the front of the Martin Luther King Jr. Labor Center, at 310 West 43rd Street, is a rarity: a monumental social-realist narrative of labor union progress bustling with human figures rendered in colorful glass mosaic that harkens to the technique’s roots in Byzantium.The mural’s arresting central image depicts two hands, one Black and one lighter-skinned, exchanging a leaflet inscribed with a quotation from the abolitionist Frederick Douglass, “If there is no struggle there can be no progress.”“We are very proud of being a labor organization and a social justice union,” said George Gresham, the president of Local 1199 of the Service Employees International Union, which commissioned the 1970 work for a sheltered recess built into its 15-story headquarters. The artist, Anton Refregier, frames the central image with vignettes of members at work, on strike, attending classes and at play.
