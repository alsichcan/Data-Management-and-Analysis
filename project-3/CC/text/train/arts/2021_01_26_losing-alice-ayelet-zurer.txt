In ‘Losing Alice,’ Ayelet Zurer Burns It All Down
In “Losing Alice,” a new Israeli psychological thriller on Apple TV+, a once-edgy film director named Alice Ginor is about to mount a career comeback. For too long, her talent has atrophied as she took paycheck gigs, like directing yogurt commercials, so that she could raise a family with her movie-star husband, David (Gal Toren).But her zest for life is renewed by a chance encounter with a sexy young screenwriter named Sophie (Lihi Kornowski) and an opportunity to direct a new movie, which ends up being difficult (it stars her husband) and possibly dangerous (the original director goes missing, and some disturbing violence in the script begins to seem less like fiction). Is Alice willing to risk her family and her marriage to make this movie?The Israeli-American actress Ayelet Zurer, known for series like “Daredevil” and “BeTipul” (remade in America as “In Treatment”), struggled with the “Losing Alice” script at first, unsure how to portray the complex title character. Things clicked, she said, when she realized that Alice is not a victim but simply a woman who is compelled to make some unusual choices, even if some are self-destructive. This comes through in Zurer’s expressive performance, in the way she can sell devastation and pride in a single look as Alice surrenders to her creative hunger.“I think people are going to think, as I did, that there is a sense of victimization and then realize, ‘Oh, it went a whole other way,’” Zurer said. “I think they will realize it’s actually very feminist forward.”
