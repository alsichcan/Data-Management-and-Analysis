France to Return Klimt Painting to Rightful Heirs After Nazi-Era Sale
PARIS — France will return the only painting by Gustav Klimt in its national collection to the heirs of Nora Stiasny, a Jewish woman who sold it under duress after the Nazis annexed Austria, France’s culture minister announced on Monday.The minister, Roselyne Bachelot, said it was difficult but necessary for France to part with Klimt’s “Rosebushes Under the Trees,” which she called a “masterpiece.”“It is the completion of an act of justice,” Bachelot said at a news conference in Paris, standing beside the early-20th-century painting, a lush, green canvas dotted with specks of floral color.“Rosebushes Under the Trees,” which currently resides at the Musée d’Orsay in the city, was not part of the special inventory of looted artworks returned from Germany to France after World War II ended. Unlike those artworks, which are not fully part of France’s national collections, the Klimt painting, which was bought in 1980, is legally considered the country’s “inalienable” property.
