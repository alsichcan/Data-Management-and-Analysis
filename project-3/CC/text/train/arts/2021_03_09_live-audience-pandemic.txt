I Miss Being Part of an Audience
Last month, I walked through the lobby of a comedy club and started to make small talk with a neon jellyfish. This may sound like a trippy, pandemic-induced dream, but it’s actually the latest experiment in live entertainment online.Using the new platform Bramble, the Brooklyn Comedy Collective recently started presenting shows that give audience members freedom to move through rooms in a virtual theater and mingle with other ticket-buyers before and after the performance. After choosing an avatar (I was a blue swan), you enter the theater and can talk to up to five people at a time whose faces emerge on the screen when you approach them. Walk away and they disappear. It’s as if a comedy club merged with a video game. Whether it’s the future of comedy is unclear, but it definitely felt like an attempt to fill a desperate need of the present.As we reach the anniversary of the shutdown, I badly miss live performances. But what has surprised me is that the loss I have felt most keenly is not that of seeing artists onstage, but of being in the audience.For more than two decades as a critic of theater and comedy, visiting performance spaces most nights of the week, I spent more time as a member of an audience than as part of any other group with the exception of my immediate family. A year away has made me appreciate the pleasures of being a face in the crowd. Before, I barely even considered it, and to the extent I did, it was to be irritated (long lines, intrusive cellphones) or reflexively hostile.
