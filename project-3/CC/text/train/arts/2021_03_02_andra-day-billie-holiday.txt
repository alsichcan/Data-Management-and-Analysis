24 Hours With Andra Day: Afrobeat and the Nixon Tapes
The singer-songwriter Andra Day was 11 when she first heard Billie Holiday’s voice. “I heard ‘Sugar’ and I heard ‘Strange Fruit.’ It changed my idea of what a great singer was,” she said. When she began performing, she chose a stage name — her given name is Cassandra Monique Batie — that paid homage to Holiday’s sobriquet, the Lady Day. And a few years ago, when she learned Lee Daniels would soon direct a Holiday biopic, Day, who had never acted professionally before, knew that she had to audition.“The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” which debuted on Hulu last month, shows how government agents worked to suppress “Strange Fruit” and how Holiday defied them. In the film, Day, swathed in opulent Prada gowns, sings song after song, which required transforming her shot-silk voice into Holiday’s raspier one.“Her voice is a scroll,” Day said, speaking from the Los Angeles home she shares with her mother and two cousins. “And her whole experience is written on it. Every time she slammed heroin, every time she did a speedball, every time she stood up against the government, every time she was hit or she dragged a cigarette, everything’s written there.”To achieve that graveled tone, Day smoked and drank. She spoke louder than normal and quit hot tea and scarves. “It was definitely a transformation emotionally, spiritually and physically,” she said.
