Rethinking What It Means to Be a Philadelphia Artist
This article is part of our latest special report on Museums, which focuses on reopening, reinvention and resilience.The artist Jesse Krimes had a unique way of adapting during his nearly yearlong stint in solitary confinement.“I didn’t have access to any materials, so I ended up using my local newspaper, pieces of prison-issued soap and playing cards sold in the commissary,” he recalled.He cut out mug shots and photos of well-known people from the paper, and transferred them onto the damp surface of slivers of soap with the help of wet toilet paper. Then he cut out the faces of the kings, queens and jacks from decks of playing cards, replacing them with the 292 soap “portraits,” and mailed them undetected to a friend outside prison.
