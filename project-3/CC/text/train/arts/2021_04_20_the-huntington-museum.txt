The Huntington Gets Hip
SAN MARINO, Calif. — The juxtaposition is striking. In one gallery, Thomas Gainsborough’s classic 18th-century oil painting, “The Blue Boy,” gazes out from the ornate walls, having just undergone an extensive restoration. In another gallery, an installation by the Los Angeles artist Monica Majoli explores Blueboy magazine, one of the earliest gay publications in the U.S., through sultry images of scantily dressed young men.When did the Huntington get hip?This is not the institution you thought you knew for its Beaux-Arts mansion, imposing research library and elegant botanical gardens, including one inspired by Suzhou, China. It’s now also a hub for cutting-edge contemporary art.For the first time, the Huntington Library, Art Museum and Botanical Gardens has joined the Hammer Museum in presenting the biennial, “Made in L.A. 2020: a version,” which spotlights videos, films, sculptures, performances and paintings by 30 Los Angeles-based artists.The show, which opened when its host museums were finally able to welcome back the public on April 17, is clearly a departure for the Huntington.
