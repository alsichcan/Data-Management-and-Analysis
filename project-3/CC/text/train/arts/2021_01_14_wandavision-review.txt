‘WandaVision’ Review: That’s Why They Became the Disney+ Bunch
R.I.P., “Jessica Jones,” “Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.,” “Runaways” and all your first-wave Marvel Television comrades. You were a motley bunch, scattered across the TV and streaming landscape, but you provided some solid entertainment value over the last seven years, until the corporate Thanos in Burbank decided your time was up.Those dozen or so shows are gone now, like residents of an errant time line, and Marvel Studios is starting over, producing its own extensive roster of superhero series for its shiny new corporate cousin, Disney+. They will be reliable members of the Marvel Cinematic Universe team, fitting more snugly into the continuity of that vast narrative-industrial complex and probably subject to a higher degree of analytics and storytelling-by-committee than their predecessors.So it’s unexpected that, after some shuffling of schedules because of the pandemic, the first product of this new regime — “WandaVision,” premiering with two episodes (out of nine) Friday on Disney+ — is an odd duck, a high-concept combination of paranoiac mystery and nostalgic pop-culture burlesque. Its two central characters are borrowed from the “Avengers” movies but they’re in very different territory here, more reminiscent in some ways of the most distinctive of the earlier Marvel shows, FX’s “Legion.” Or of one of the more metafictional episodes of “The Simpsons,” though not nearly as funny.Odd does not, by itself, equal good, and on the evidence of the three episodes made available for review, the eccentricities of “WandaVision” are mostly just weighing it down. It feels as if we’re still waiting for the real show to get started, and even with half-hour episodes (reminiscent of the hit Disney+ sci-fi serial, “The Mandalorian”) that’s a long time to wait. “The Mandalorian” had the good sense to introduce Baby Yoda in Episode 1.
