A New Writer for Superman
When the Brian Michael Bendis run on Superman and Action Comics ended (the last issue he wrote came out in December), readers wondered who the next writer would be. Not many would have predicted Phillip Kennedy Johnson would be the one.“Bendis casts a long shadow and is a legend in the industry,” said Johnson, whose previous credits includes limited series and specials. “I think people expected someone of a similar stature to take over.”Fans were able to preview Johnson’s take on Superman in Future State, a two-month storyline that began in January, which explored DC’s heroes decades, and sometimes eons, from now. Susana Polo, the comics editor on the gaming and pop culture website Polygon, wrote, “After reading his Future State Superman books, I’m very excited to see where this lyrical writer with a flare for epic events and asking for epic visuals goes.”It is an exciting time to be a fan of the Man of Steel. The CW series “Superman & Lois” debuted last month and it was announced last week that the writer Ta-Nehisi Coates is working on a Superman screenplay to be produced by J.J. Abrams.
