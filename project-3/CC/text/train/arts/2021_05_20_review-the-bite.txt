Review: From ‘The Good Wife’ to the Covid Zombie Apocalypse
OK, so you missed Broadway for the past year and you felt bad about all the theater people who were put out of work by the pandemic. But ask yourself: Did you do anything about it? Because Michelle and Robert King sure did.The Kings, who have provided employment for numerous New York and Chicago stage actors over the years in their television series “The Good Wife” and “The Good Fight,” pulled out all the stops for “The Bite,” a Covid-19 zombie-apocalypse satire premiering Friday as a Spectrum original. The cast includes at least six Tony winners, with 14 awards among them, and another nine nominees. Altogether, around 35 performers with Broadway experience made it into the credits.That total is particularly impressive for a couple of reasons. “The Bite” is only six episodes. And since it is in the small, and possibly temporary, genre of the self-conscious, safely filmed pandemic narrative, the main action is limited to a few rooms (and a lot of video screens) and largely played by a handful of real-life couples.The presence of all those stage actors feels appropriate, though, because “The Bite” feels like summer-stock TV, or like a play that’s literally being put on in someone’s living room. Modestly clever, consistently lively, funny in some spots and tedious in others, it’s a shaggy-virus story that holds your attention, if it does, because of its surplus of talent.
