For Chakaia Booker, Whose Medium Is Tires, the Art Is in the Journey
ALLENTOWN, Pa. — Chakaia Booker’s studio here is 20,000 square feet of unheated space, with a roof that leaks and a squirrel problem. Its floor is grooved in places with tracks from its past life as a trolley maintenance shed.Now there is a woodworking area, a metal shop, a ceramics room. There are power tools, precision cutters and a forklift, as Booker’s materials are heavy and her sculptures large. And there are tires — stacked high on shelving; sliced in rounds, shredded, heaped pell-mell.For over 30 years, Booker has worked mainly with automotive rubber. In the 1980s, she retrieved blown-out tires in Manhattan’s pregentrified East Village, where she still lives. Now, her sources include Michelin, which sends her used tires from racecars and motorcycles.Distinctive and idiosyncratic, her oeuvre transcends the material’s utilitarian vocation and belies its uniformity. The sculptures can be robust and monumental, or finely detailed and uncannily tender. Some are almost figurative, the rubber cut, flexed and positioned in layers or strands to evoke the human body or more cryptic forms.
