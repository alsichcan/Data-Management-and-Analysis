A Choreographer Who Bridges the Worlds of Dance and Nursing
In the opening scene of the film “deadbird,” the choreographer Devynn Emory assembles a mannequin on the floor of an empty studio, carefully slotting body parts together: arms into torso, lower legs into thighs. As this process unfolds, Emory and the mannequin, in a voice-over, introduce themselves. They converse as equals, no hierarchy between human and object.“If I was a structure, I’d be a bridge,” Emory says after finishing the assembly, lying side by side with the mannequin and gazing up at the ceiling. Seen from above, the two are mirror images.In “deadbird,” which will be presented online by Danspace Project from March 31 to April 3, Emory (who uses the pronouns they and them) bridges dimensions of their work that might seem to have little in common: as a dancer and choreographer, and as a registered nurse who often cares for dying patients. But Emory, 40, sees nursing as “not so far away from dancing,” they said in a video interview. “It’s really just another understanding of how the body works.”
