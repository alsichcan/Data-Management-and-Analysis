Carol Bove’s Light-Touch Heavy Metal Faces Down the Met
“I didn’t want them to sit politely on the pedestals,” Carol Bove said to me this past summer.The sculptor was tiptoeing around a pile of crushed, tangled steel tubes, lying on the floor of her studio in the far south of Brooklyn. She’d reopened her workshop after a pandemic shutdown, and all around were the accouterments of art and industry. Forklifts and girders. Welders’ masks and hazmat suits. But there was also, rather incongruously, a shadow of a century past: a huge plaster replica of a Beaux-Arts sculpture pedestal, a full-scale copy of the empty ones on the facade of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.The crumpled tubes would form part of one of Bove’s largest-ever projects, for the museum’s second commission of new outdoor sculpture. Last week, after a six-month Covid-induced delay, the completed works were driven uptown and were being craned into place at 1000 Fifth Avenue.There are four of them: abstract compositions of torqued and sandblasted steel, each around 11 feet tall, affixed with burnished discs of aluminum and placed on either side of the Met’s sweeping staircase. They’ll be here until November, and they indeed sit on their pedestals with a pleasant impertinence: thrust a bit too far forward, balanced a tick too precariously, looming a smidgen too large.
