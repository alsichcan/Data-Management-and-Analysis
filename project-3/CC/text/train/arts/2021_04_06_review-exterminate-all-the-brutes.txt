Review: ‘Exterminate All the Brutes’ Rewrites a Brutal History
“The very existence of this film is a miracle,” Raoul Peck says in “Exterminate All the Brutes,” a documentary he wrote, directed and narrated. He’s referring to the existence of a film that retells the history of colonialism and slavery from a nonwhite, non-Western viewpoint, though in 2021 that may seem less like a miracle than an expectation.What’s more miraculous is that Peck found a home on mainstream American television — yes, it’s HBO, but still — for a supremely personal, impressionistic yet intellectualized, four-hour cascade of images, ruminations and historical aperçus. (The busy editor was Alexandra Strauss.) That would be an impressive achievement on any subject, let alone genocide.The title “Exterminate All the Brutes,” with its combination of blunt force and literary flourish (and its suggestion that history has misidentified the real brutes), is appropriate to a project that elaborates on and aestheticizes feelings of outrage, disbelief and despair. (It was taken from Joseph Conrad’s “Heart of Darkness” and from a 1996 book by the historian Sven Lindqvist that is one of several scholarly sources Peck drew on.)The film, whose four chapters premiere Wednesday and Thursday nights, is unrelenting in its critique, but it’s also more muted in tone than that title might suggest. Peck’s slightly droning narration contributes to that effect, as does an approach that’s more free-associative than truly essayistic. There’s also, unfortunately, the documentary’s tendency to cycle through and circle around a relatively small set of ideas that would have had more force in a shorter film.
