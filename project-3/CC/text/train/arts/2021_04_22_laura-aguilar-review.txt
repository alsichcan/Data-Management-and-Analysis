She Turned Her Audacious Lens on Herself, and Shaped the Future
It feels good — a relief — to know that the photographer Laura Aguilar, who died in 2018, lived long enough to see her fine career survey, which opened a year earlier in her hometown Los Angeles, and has now, at last, landed in New York.It’s a movingly, sometimes discomfortingly intimate show. To know Aguilar’s art is, to an unusual degree, to know her, and to care about her, and to care about what she cared about: under-the-radar, under-threat social communities and hard-won personal survival.Titled “Laura Aguilar: Show and Tell,” the retrospective was part of “Pacific Standard Time: LA/LA,” the Getty Foundation-sponsored extravaganza in 2017 of more than 70 concurrent exhibitions in and around Los Angeles that together demonstrated the influence of Latin America and Latino art on the city. A few of the bigger, splashier entries traveled, without delay, from Los Angeles to New York, one to the Met, another to the Brooklyn Museum. It would have made sense for the Aguilar show to head East too, to the Whitney maybe, or the New Museum. But it’s only getting here now, four years late, half its initial size and hosted by a small, punchy, queer-positive outlier institution, the Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art in Soho.
