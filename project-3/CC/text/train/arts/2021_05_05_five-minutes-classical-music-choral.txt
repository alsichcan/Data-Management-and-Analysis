5 Minutes That Will Make You Love Choral Music
In the past, we’ve chosen the five minutes or so we would play to make our friends fall in love with classical music, the piano, opera, the cello, Mozart, 21st-century composers, the violin, Baroque music, sopranos, Beethoven, the flute, string quartets, tenors and Brahms.Now we want to convince those curious friends to love choral music — the gorgeous sound of a mass of voices. We hope you find lots here to discover and enjoy; leave your favorites in the comments.When I first heard Marcel Cellier’s compilation album “Le Mystère Des Voix Bulgares,” I was struck by the choir’s vocal quality: raw and direct, with a supreme clarity — and unlike anything I’d heard before. In “Kalimankou Denkou,” a powerful solo by Yanka Rupkina is wrapped in rich, cascading harmony, unfolding with organic complexity. This is perfect tonal music, where harmony and melody reinforce each other to convey deep expression. I hope it leads you down a YouTube rabbit hole in the vocal music not only of Bulgaria, but also nearby areas like Albania, Greece, Georgia and Corsica.
