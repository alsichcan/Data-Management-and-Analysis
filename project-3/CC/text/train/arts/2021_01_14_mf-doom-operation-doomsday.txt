MF Doom, Magician of Memory
“By candlelight, my hand will write these rhymes ’til I’m burnt out,” MF Doom raps at the beginning of “?,” the final song before the epilogue on his 1999 debut album, “Operation: Doomsday.”In its video, Doom is indeed at the end of his wick. He staggers through a park, clutching a machete in one hand and a bottle of Jack Daniels in the other. He’s roaming, unsteady. You feel for him.The song concludes with an affectionate remembrance for his brother, Subroc, who was killed in a car accident in 1993. “My twin brother, we did everything together/From hundred rakat salahs to copping butter leathers,” Doom raps, then concludes the verse with a portrait of grief and resilience: “Truly the illest dynamic duo on the whole block/I keep a flick of you with the machete sword in your hand/Everything is going according to plan, man.”
