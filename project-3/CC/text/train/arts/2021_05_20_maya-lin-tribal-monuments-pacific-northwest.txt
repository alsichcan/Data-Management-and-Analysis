Along the Columbia River, Making a Monument of the Land
This article is part of our latest special report on Museums, which focuses on reopening, reinvention and resilience.On a spring morning, the Vancouver Land Bridge appears to be a bridge alive, lush with native plants fluttering in the wind as joggers follow its wavy path. Its long arc — about a third of a mile — weaves and soars over Highway 14, reconnecting the Columbia River with the ancient Klickitat Trail, said to have been used by Northwest tribes for millenniums.Ten miles north of Portland, Ore., the earth-covered pedestrian bridge, completed in 2008, was a collaboration between the architect Johnpaul Jones, best known for his work on the National Museum of the American Indian in Washington, and the artist and architect Maya Lin, who designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.Mr. Jones and his architectural firm created the maquette of the land bridge that is the centerpiece of “Along the Columbia River: Maya Lin and the Confluence Project,” which will be on view through Dec. 15 at Whitman College’s Maxey Museum in Walla Walla, Wash., and online.
