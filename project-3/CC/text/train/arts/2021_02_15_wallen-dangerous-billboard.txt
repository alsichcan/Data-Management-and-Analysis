Morgan Wallen Holds Onto No. 1 Again Following Use of Racial Slur
Nearly two weeks and two apologies later, Morgan Wallen, the country singer who was promptly condemned by the music industry for using a racial slur, is still No. 1 on the charts — and his sales have increased.Earlier this month, in a clip published by TMZ, Wallen was seen on camera casually yelling the anti-Black slur after a night of drinking with friends. The very day next, his chart-topping music was removed from radio stations and streaming service playlists, and his label said, however vaguely, that it was suspending Wallen’s contract.In a five-minute video posted last week, the singer, one of country music’s biggest new stars, said that he was wrong and that he was sorry for his language. “It’s on me to take ownership for this and I fully accept the penalties I’m facing,” Wallen said.But those rebukes have not much affected his commercial standing, with Wallen’s latest album, “Dangerous: The Double Album,” now spending its fifth straight week at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart with the equivalent of 150,000 sales in the United States. Wallen’s songs were streamed 146 million times, down slightly from 154 million the week prior, but his traditional album sales were up 49 percent to 37,000, more than enough to maintain his reign at No. 1.
