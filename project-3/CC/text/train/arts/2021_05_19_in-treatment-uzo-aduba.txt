‘In Treatment’ Is Back. How Does That Make You Feel?
The writer Jennifer Schuur (“My Brilliant Friend,” “Unbelievable”) has seen the same therapist every week for 17 years. “It is one of the most significant relationships of my life,” she said. Sometimes friends and family question that longevity.“I say, ‘I walk out every single time feeling better than I did going in,’” Schuur said. “‘So why would I stop that?’”She hasn’t stopped. She kept up with her appointments, remotely, all through Los Angeles’s lockdown. And last summer, when HBO executives began to consider a revival of the therapy-focused drama “In Treatment,” she and Joshua Allen (“Empire”) quickly signed on as showrunners. This new “In Treatment,” which stars Uzo Aduba as the clinical psychologist Dr. Brooke Taylor, premieres on HBO on Sunday, offering four episodes per week for six weeks.In a year in which record numbers of adults have reported anxiety, depression and symptoms consistent with post-traumatic stress disorder, an experienced — and yes, OK, fictional — clinician is here to help.
