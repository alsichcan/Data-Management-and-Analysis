Mary Ellen Moylan, Acclaimed Balanchine Dancer, Is Dead at 94
Mary Ellen Moylan was 11 and attending a ballet school in her hometown, St. Petersburg, Fla., when her mother saw a magazine article about George Balanchine’s newly formed School of American Ballet.“I’m going to send you there,” she told her daughter. “You look good in Florida, but let’s see how you look in New York.”Ms. Moylan looked pretty good in New York. Molded by the Balanchine school, which was founded in 1934, her dancing became “precise, clearly articulated, but delicate and highly expressive,” the ballerina Maria Tallchief (who was Balanchine’s third wife) wrote in a reminiscence in The Chicago Tribune in 1997.Still in her teens, Ms. Moylan began to perform principal roles with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, where Balanchine, ever more enthusiastic about her work, was the resident choreographer.
