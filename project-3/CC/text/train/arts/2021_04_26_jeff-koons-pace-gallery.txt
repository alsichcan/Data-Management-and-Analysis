Jeff Koons Moves to Pace Gallery
In an effort to reboot and to consolidate management of his sales, the mega-artist Jeff Koons is moving from two mega-galleries to one.Pace Gallery on Monday announced that it will begin representing Jeff Koons exclusively worldwide.“He is one of the great living artists, who changed the way we look at our culture and at each other,” Marc Glimcher, Pace’s chief executive and president, said in a phone interview.“Having been so committed to sculpture for 60 years,” Glimcher added, “we think we have something to contribute to the next phase of Jeff’s career.”Pace’s first collaboration with Koons will be an exhibition of a single sculpture at the gallery’s space in Palo Alto, Calif., in 2022, followed by a major New York exhibition of new work in 2023.
