The Pandemic Needs Its Smokey Bear
Newham, a borough of northeast London, is known as the main site of the 2012 Summer Olympics and as home to an immigrant community that speaks more than 100 languages. Last year, it added a less flattering distinction. From March to December, it had the highest coronavirus death rate of anywhere in England or Wales — 328 deaths per 100,000 people.Three months ago, health experts came up with an innovative way to curtail this ghastly toll. The council, as local government here is called, rented rooms at two Newham hotels. At one, people with Covid-19 could check in and stay until they recovered. At another, a healthy person who had sick family or housemates could live until it was safe to return home. The government would pay the tab and deliver free fresh food.The deal seemed compelling. But since January, when the hotel rooms were secured, food shipments were arranged and the Enhanced Isolation program was announced, the offer has been strikingly low on a crucial element: participants. One person with Covid-19 has checked into the “hot” hotel, as it’s known. And one person has stayed at the hotel for healthy people avoiding sick housemates.What’s the problem? On a Zoom call one morning, Anne Bowers, who runs communications for the borough’s health campaigns, looked for answers. She canvassed a group of volunteers with roots in immigrant communities in Newham, who have evangelized about pandemic outreach efforts.
