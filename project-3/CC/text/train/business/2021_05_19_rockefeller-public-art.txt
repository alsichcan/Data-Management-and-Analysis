In New York and More, Public Art Is Taking on Thorny Social Issues
This article is part of our latest special report on Museums, which focuses on reopening, reinvention and resilience.Sanford Biggers, a New York City-based multimedia artist whose bold and edgy artwork tackles thorny social, political and economic themes — often through a historic lens — installed more than 100 pieces throughout the public spaces of Rockefeller Center in Manhattan in early May.A massive, 25-foot-tall bronze sculpture titled “Oracle” and a series of small-scale ones that combine African masks and European figures, mixed media works using antique quilts, and a 125-foot-long mural entitled “Just Us” that questions ideas of justice, are among those on view through June 29.“It’s the first time we’ve invited an artist to take over the entire campus in the history of Rockefeller Center,” said Rob Speyer, president and chief executive of Tishman Speyer, the real estate firm that owns the landmark property.
