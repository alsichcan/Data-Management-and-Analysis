An S.U.V.? Ferrari Sees the Writing on the Road
Like Porsche, Lamborghini and Aston Martin before it — and every workaday carmaker following the crowds — Ferrari is getting into the S.U.V. business.Ferrari’s Purosangue, for “thoroughbred” in Italian, isn’t expected until 2022. But sports-car traditionalists are already grinding teeth like the gears in their manual transmissions.The gripe seems to be that Ferrari, from its perch atop autodom, needn’t stoop to conquer the S.U.V. market, to chase consumer whims from America to China. This is the company whose sports cars are so exclusive — built of “unobtanium,” in popular parlance — that they often appreciate in value the minute an owner peels out of the dealership lot. That is, once a prospective owner has been vetted by Ferrari or its dealers and granted permission to buy one. That process can seem as byzantine and mysterious as an audience with another Italian icon, whose address is Vatican City rather than Maranello.A classic Ferrari is worth its weight in Tesla stock, and the fabled 250 GTO has become the most valuable car in history: A 1963 GTO, one of 39 ever built, was reportedly purchased for more than $70 million in 2018. The same year, a 1962 GTO set the record for public sale, fetching $48.4 million at auction.
