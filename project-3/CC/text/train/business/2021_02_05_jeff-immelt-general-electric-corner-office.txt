Jeff Immelt Oversaw the Downfall of G.E. Now He’d Like You to Read His Book.
There are two ways to think about Jeff Immelt’s 16-year run as chief executive of General Electric.The charitable interpretation is that Mr. Immelt was dealt an impossible hand. He followed the two-decade reign of Jack Welch, during which G.E. became the most valuable company in the world. His second day on the job was Sept. 11, 2001, and fallout from the terrorist attacks left several of G.E.’s major business lines battered. And G.E. Capital, which Mr. Welch built into what was essentially a giant unregulated bank, was a ticking time bomb that almost blew up during the financial crisis.The less charitable interpretation is that Mr. Immelt bears singular responsibility for allowing G.E. to fall apart. Mr. Immelt paid too much for some acquisitions and didn’t get enough for some divestitures. Rather than rein in G.E. Capital, he let it spin out of control. And critics contend he was set in his ways, misguided in his big bets and unable to adapt to changing market conditions.Either way, the results were disastrous. On Mr. Immelt’s watch, G.E. stock plunged some 30 percent, wiping out more than $150 billion in market value and obliterating the savings of thousands of G.E. retirees. Since Mr. Immelt was pushed out in 2017, it has only gotten worse. G.E. was dropped from the Dow Jones industrial average, its stock has continued to slide and it recently paid $200 million to settle with the Securities and Exchange Commission for misleading investors. Once a paragon of modern management excellence, G.E. became a punchline.It was a stunning fall for a company that was among the country’s most admired corporations for a century, popularizing everything from the light bulb to the refrigerator, mass-producing televisions and washing machines, and ushering in the modern age with jet engines, power plants and plastics used during the moon landing.
