Robert Altman, Video Game Mogul Who Survived Scandal, Dies at 73
Robert A. Altman, a consummate Washington insider who survived a global banking scandal to reanimate himself as the mogul of a multibillion-dollar video game conglomerate, died on Feb. 3 in Baltimore. He was 73.The cause was complications of a medical procedure, said his son, James, an executive of ZeniMax, which his father sold to Microsoft last year for $7.5 billion.Mr. Altman’s company was a household name among gamers who enjoyed the apocalyptic challenges of Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, Doom and Rage. He was probably most widely known as the husband of Lynda Carter, who starred in the 1970s television series “Wonder Woman.”But among the cognoscenti, he was known as the agile defense lawyer who kept prominent political figures out of prison, and as the junior law partner of Clark M. Clifford, among the last of Washington’s 20th-century “wise men,” with whom Mr. Altman became embroiled in accusations surrounding what was then the largest financial fraud in history.
