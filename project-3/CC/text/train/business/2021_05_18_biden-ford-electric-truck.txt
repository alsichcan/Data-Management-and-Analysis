Electric Pickups Could Make or Break Biden’s Infrastructure Plans
President Biden had toured a vehicle factory and delivered a policy speech, but he was not going to leave Michigan without taking a new electric pickup truck out for a spin.He raced around a test track in the electric version of Ford’s iconic F-150 pickup, showing off the features he and his administration say could help to sell Americans on a low-emission, electric-car future that stretches from suburban driveways to rural back roads.“This sucker’s quick,” Mr. Biden told reporters through an open window of the prototype truck, before hitting the gas.But the transition he is championing, from gas guzzlers to plug-in powerhouses, will be anything but swift. Mr. Biden and Republicans in Congress are at odds over the president’s $4 trillion economic agenda and the best way to help America in its race with China in the decades of global economic competition to come.
