Volvo Plans to Sell Only Electric Cars by 2030
Volvo Cars one-upped larger rivals like General Motors and added momentum to the movement toward electric vehicles on Tuesday by saying it would convert its entire lineup to battery power by 2030, no longer selling cars with internal combustion engines.The declaration by the Swedish carmaker is the latest attempt by a traditional auto company to break with its fossil fuels past. It is also one of the most ambitious proposals and ratchets up the pressure on others to follow suit.The auto industry has been moving toward electrification for years, but the shift has taken on new urgency in recent months. President Bidenâ€™s election, along with his commitment to fight climate change, has raised expectations that the United States will offer the kind of incentives that helped make electric cars the fastest-growing segment of the European market last year.Where once automakers bragged about horsepower and acceleration, now they are competing to be the greenest. G.M. said in January that it would go all electric by 2035. Ford said last month that it would sell only battery-powered cars in Europe starting in 2030, and the maker of Jaguar luxury cars made a similar promise.
