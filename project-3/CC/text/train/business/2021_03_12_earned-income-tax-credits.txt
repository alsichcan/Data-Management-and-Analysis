A Break for Working Families
Working families who rely on a federal tax credit to help pay the bills are getting a break this tax season: They can qualify for the credit based on whichever year’s income — 2019 or 2020 — puts the most cash in their pocket.The earned-income tax credit was claimed by about 27 million people in 2019, mostly lower- and middle-income Americans with children.The maximum credit for 2020 is $6,660, for families with three or more children. Last year, the average credit was about $2,500 a return, the Internal Revenue Service reports.“It’s quite substantial,” said Timothy Flacke, executive director of Commonwealth, a nonprofit organization in Boston that promotes financial security.
