Eurozone banks are underestimating risks from the pandemic, E.C.B. warns.
The European Central Bank on Thursday effectively warned eurozone banks to clean up their acts, saying that many are complacent about losses they may suffer from a surge in problem loans caused by the pandemic.The central bank, which has ultimate supervisory authority over commercial banks in the 19 countries that belong to the eurozone, also said that top managers at many lenders were not doing a good job of overseeing their operations and that many banks lacked a clear plan to address chronically weak profits.No large European banks have failed since the pandemic hit. That is largely because after the financial crisis a decade ago, regulators forced lenders to reduce risk and increase their ability to absorb losses.But in its annual report on the health of eurozone banks, the European Central Bank said that risks to banks remained high, especially as government support programs begin to run out.
