The Unequal Inheritance: It Can Work, or It Can ‘Destroy Relationships’
For most older parents, it is simpler to leave each adult child the same inheritance. But is equal always equitable? For many, the answer is no. And as the pandemic drives people to draft or update their estate plans, more are confronting that question.Consider the dilemma that one of Elizabeth Candido Petite’s clients faced last year. Ms. Petite, an estate planning lawyer in Westfield, N.J., said the parents, who have three adult children, “felt very strongly about giving more to one child because she needed it more.”The child, a daughter, had been laid off during the pandemic, and though the parents were helping her pay current expenses, Ms. Petite said, they also “foresaw that she would always need extra help.” Their other two adult children were in higher-paying careers.The two siblings did not object. “The family talked it through, and everyone was on the same track,” she said.
