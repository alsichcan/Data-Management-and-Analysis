Ranks of the long-term jobless are bigger than the numbers show.
When the economy shut down last spring, many workers thought they would be out of a job for a few weeks, maybe a couple of months.Nine months later, many still aren’t back on the job.The Labor Department’s monthly jobs report on Friday showed that nearly four million Americans had been out of work for more than six months, economists’ standard threshold for long-term unemployment. That was up by 27,000 from November, and roughly quadruple the number before the pandemic began.Those figures almost certainly understate the scope of the problem. People who aren’t looking for work, whether because they don’t believe jobs are available or because they are caring for children or other family members, aren’t counted as unemployed.
