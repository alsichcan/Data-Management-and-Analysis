SpongeBob, ‘Star Trek’ and sports drive subscriptions to Paramount+.
SpongeBob, “Star Trek” and the Super Bowl have attracted new subscribers to ViacomCBS’s streaming platforms.The company, led by Shari Redstone, rebranded its long-running streaming service as Paramount+ in March, while providing it with a slew of new shows, films and sports programming. The company also added content to Pluto, its free streaming service.The stronger commitment to digital media has created a revenue powerhouse, with streaming sales jumping 65 percent to $816 million in the first quarter, the company reported Thursday. ViacomCBS said it had added six million new streaming subscribers to both Paramount+ and a smaller streaming service, Showtime, bringing the total to 36 million.The company doesn’t disclose how many customers are coming to each platform, but the majority have bought Paramount+, a cheaper service at $6 a month with ads, or $10 a month without commercials. ViacomCBS plans to offer a new tier at $5 a month in June in an effort to drive more subscribers. That should help the company sell more ads, offsetting the price drop.
