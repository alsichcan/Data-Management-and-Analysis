Jobless Claims Show Little Sign That Layoffs Are Easing
New claims for state unemployment remain stubbornly high as the labor market struggles to regain momentum after the winter surge in coronavirus cases.A total of 862,000 workers filed initial claims for state unemployment benefits last week, roughly the same number as the revised total for the week before, the Labor Department said Thursday. On a seasonally adjusted basis, the total was 861,000, an increase of 13,000.After initial claims hit recent highs from late December to mid-January, economists had expected a steady downward trend.
