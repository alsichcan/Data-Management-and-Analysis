Learning How to Invest From the Pros
William Green has set himself a daunting task in “Richer, Wiser, Happier” (Scribner, $28.)There is nothing wrong with his premise, which is clearly spelled out in his new book’s subtitle: “How the world’s greatest investors win in markets and life.” The challenge is that Mr. Green, who was an editor at Time magazine, has decided to go boldly where hundreds of writers have gone before.A quick search turned up more than three dozen books on the approach that Warren E. Buffett, a central figure in this book, takes when it comes to investing. And many of Mr. Green’s other subjects, such as Howard Marks, of Oaktree Capital Management, and the tech veteran Mohnish Pabrai, have written their own books.In fact, the idea of learning investing secrets of the pros has been around so long that when I worked at Forbes and Business Week in the 1980s, my colleagues and I joked that the typical Fortune cover was “How Bill Gates Made a Billion Dollars, and You Can, Too.”But to his credit, Mr. Green manages to make the book worth your while, whether you pick your own stocks and buy actively managed mutual funds or are looking for confirmation that index funds are the way to go.
