Are Americans Shopping Again? Macy’s Sales Jump Suggests a Return Is Afoot.
A combination of government stimulus and faster-than-expected vaccinations drove a sales rebound at Macy’s over the past three months, in what could signal the start of a post-pandemic shopping boom.Macy’s said on Tuesday that sales jumped 56 percent in its first quarter, which ended May 1, from the same period last year, when the start of the pandemic pulverized the retailer’s revenue. It raised its sales and profit forecast for the year.The company, which also owns Bloomingdale’s, reported $4.7 billion in sales and a profit of $103 million. That compares with about $3 billion in sales and a loss of $3.6 billion in the same period last year.“Vaccinations were faster than expected,” Jeff Gennette, the chief executive of Macy’s, said in an interview on Tuesday. “As the vaccination rates climbed and customers became more and more comfortable, kind of emerging from their pandemic behavior, we definitely saw it in a real pickup in store traffic — and then once they were in stores, how they responded with their purchases.”
