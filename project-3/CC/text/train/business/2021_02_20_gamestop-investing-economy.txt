The Boredom Economy
Mark Hawkins is an expert on being bored.When he was getting his counseling degree, he was fascinated by articles on the therapeutic benefits of boredom. He has written a book whose title is “The Power of Boredom.” In his spare time, he likes to sit on his couch and stare out the window.“It’s very difficult, but I do try to be bored as much as possible,” he said in a recent interview.Yet during the pandemic, even Mr. Hawkins, 42, who lives in British Columbia with his wife, has at times gotten bored of being bored.Desperate for some stimulation, he has turned to Amazon, where he orders “mainly books” like Ursula K. Le Guin’s translation of the Tao Te Ching and “The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying,” by Sogyal Rinpoche.“I’m getting things delivered within a few hours of ordering them,” Mr. Hawkins said. “In terms of how it’s affecting the economy, we are wanting to buy more and more and more because a lot of us are bored at home, so we’re online shopping.”
