How Car Collecting Powered Through the Pandemic
Joe Boyd, a civil litigation lawyer in Macon, Ga., had been scouting for a 1970s Toyota Land Cruiser for some time. Last May, in the thick of the pandemic, he pounced.“I’d just started my own solo practice, but all the courts were closed because of Covid-19,” said Mr. Boyd, 49, who spotted a fully restored 1975 model in an online ad. “So it turned out to be a great time for me to do this.”Grabbing a buddy, he flew some 900 miles to Garage Kept Motors in Grand Rapids, Mich., and drove away with his dream car — which came with a refinished matching trailer and its own roof-mounted surfboard — for $27,000.Rather than back away from classic automobiles because of the pandemic, buyers flocked to them, sometimes in stunning numbers. Online auto sales and auctions, starting to gain acceptance among collectors before the virus, took off, and some tent-pole auctions with limited attendance claimed new records.
