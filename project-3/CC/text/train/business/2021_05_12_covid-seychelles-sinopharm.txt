World’s Most Vaccinated Nation Is Spooked by Covid Spike
Marie Neige, a call center operator in Seychelles, was eager to be vaccinated. Like the majority of the residents in the tiny island nation, she received China’s Sinopharm vaccine in March, and expected to be fully protected in a few weeks.On Sunday, she tested positive for the coronavirus.“I was shocked,” said Ms. Neige, 30, who is isolating at home. She said she had lost her sense of smell and taste and had a slightly sore throat. “The vaccine was supposed to protect us — not from the virus, but the symptoms,” she said. “I was taking precaution after precaution.”China expected its Sinopharm vaccines to be the linchpin of the country’s vaccine diplomacy program — an easily transported dose that would protect not just Chinese citizens but also much of the developing world. In a bid to win good will, China has donated 13.3 million Sinopharm doses to other countries, according to Bridge Beijing, a consultancy that tracks China’s impact on global health.Instead, the company, which has made two varieties of coronavirus vaccines, is facing mounting questions about the inoculations. First, there was the lack of transparency with its late-stage trial data. Now, Seychelles, the world’s most vaccinated nation, has had a surge in cases even though much of its population was inoculated with Sinopharm.
