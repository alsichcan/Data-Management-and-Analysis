John Williamson, 83, Dies; Economist Defined the ‘Washington Consensus’
John Williamson, a British economist who in 1989 coined the phrase “Washington Consensus” to describe a set of policy reforms for developing economies, then spent the rest of his career trying to rescue it from misuse by both free-market ideologues and anti-globalization activists, died on Sunday at his home in Chevy Chase, Md. He was 83.His daughter, Theresa Williamson, said the cause was multiple system atrophy, a rare degenerative disease.More than most economists, Mr. Williamson had a knack for crafting catchy names for complicated ideas. In 1965 he developed what he called the “crawling peg,” in which a central bank would keep an exchange rate fixed but establish a formula for devaluing its currency over time and in response to changing external pressure.He later mocked the view that changes in a country’s trade deficit would have no impact on exchange rates — a position advocated by the editorial board of The Wall Street Journal, among others — as “the doctrine of immaculate transfer.”
