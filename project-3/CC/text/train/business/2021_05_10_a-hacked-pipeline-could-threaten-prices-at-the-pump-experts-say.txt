A hacked pipeline could threaten prices at the pump, experts say.
Energy analysts warned that a prolonged suspension of an oil pipeline could raise prices at the pump along the East Coast and leave some smaller airports scrambling for jet fuel, Clifford Krauss reports for The New York Times.The operator of the pipeline, the largest between Texas and New York, declined on Sunday to say when it would reopen. Colonial Pipeline said that it was developing “a system restart plan” and would restore service to some small lines between terminals and delivery points but “will bring our full system back online only when we believe it is safe to do so.”The company, which shut down the pipeline on Friday, has acknowledged that it was the victim of a ransomware attack by a criminal group, meaning that the hacker might hold the company’s data hostage until it pays a ransom. Colonial Pipeline, which is privately held, would not say whether it had paid a ransom. By failing to state a timeline for reopening, the company renewed questions about whether the operations of the pipeline could still be in jeopardy.The F.B.I. said on Monday that the attack was caused by DarkSide ransomware, a strain of computer virus deployed by an eponymous group, confirming earlier reports.
