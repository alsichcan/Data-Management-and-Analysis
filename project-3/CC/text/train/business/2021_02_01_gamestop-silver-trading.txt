Silver Rises With Hype It’s the Next GameStop, but a Backlash Mutes Gains
After the frantic price swings of companies like GameStop and AMC Entertainment tantalized the financial world last week, everyone wondered what the army of internet investors would set its sights on next.The answer, at least briefly, seemed to be silver.Over the weekend, the precious metal experienced a surge of interest along with an uptick in online chatter about the chances for generating the kind of price spike that grabbed the world’s attention last week.On Monday, the price of silver jumped as much as 11.5 percent in early trading — to the highest level in eight years — but gravity soon took hold, pulling it back down as efforts to rally users of Reddit’s influential Wall Street Bets forum failed to take hold.By midmorning, silver had given up some of its early gains, and at 3 p.m., the price was $29.418 per ounce, a 9 percent increase. That was still around its highest level since early 2013.
