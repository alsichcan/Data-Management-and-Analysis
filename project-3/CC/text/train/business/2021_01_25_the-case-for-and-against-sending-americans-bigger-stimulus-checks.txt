The case for and against sending Americans bigger stimulus checks.
Are $2,000 stimulus checks a good way to help the economy and fight poverty or a misuse of government resources?The centerpiece of President Biden’s coronavirus economic relief plan — to send Americans another $1,400 in addition to the $600 already authorized by Congress — polls well with the public, but some economists and politicians from both parties have reservations.In The Morning newsletter, David Leonhardt lays out three main arguments both for and against the idea, based on his conversations with experts:1. People need help. Almost 10 million fewer Americans are working now than when the pandemic began, and normal life is still months from returning. The checks will let people decide for themselves how to spend the money, and much of this spending will stimulate the economy and create jobs.2. It’s simple. At a time when many people don’t trust the government, easy-to-understand policies can build trust. The Obama administration designed a complex stimulus program in 2009 and didn’t get much political credit for it.
