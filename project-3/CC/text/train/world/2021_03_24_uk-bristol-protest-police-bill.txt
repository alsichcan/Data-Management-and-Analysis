14 Arrested at Protest Over U.K. Policing Bill
LONDON — Fourteen protesters have been arrested in Bristol, in southwestern England, at a rally to denounce a policing bill that would enact restrictions on peaceful demonstrations. The rally, part of a wider movement against the proposed legislation, came after clashes in the city on Sunday that left officers wounded and drew condemnation from officials.About 200 people attended the protest on Tuesday night, far fewer than the thousands who took part in the demonstrations in Bristol on Sunday, but the gathering was broken up by the authorities, citing coronavirus restrictions. The protest was more subdued than the violent scenes days earlier. In footage shared online, protesters could be seen chanting “peaceful protest” and sitting in the street in front of police officers in riot gear.The police said in a statement that reinforcements had been drafted after “efforts to encourage people to leave were unsuccessful.”The police cited breaches of coronavirus rules and the obstruction of a highway as the reason for the arrests. One of the people arrested on Tuesday had also been held in connection with the violence on Sunday.
