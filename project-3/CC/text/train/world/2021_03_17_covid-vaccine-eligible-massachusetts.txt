Massachusetts joins a growing number of states rapidly expanding vaccine eligibility, some exceeding Biden’s May 1 deadline.
Not long ago, Covid-19 vaccines were available only to the most vulnerable Americans and some essential workers. That is quickly changing as vaccine production and distribution ramp up and more states begin to heed a call from President Biden to expand access to all adults by May.States are also racing to stay ahead of the growing number of virus variants, some of which are more contagious and possibly even more deadly.At least four states — Maine, Virginia, North Carolina and Wisconsin — and Washington, D.C., have said that they will expand eligibility to their general population by May 1, the deadline that Mr. Biden set last week. Other states — including Colorado, Connecticut, Ohio, Massachusetts, Michigan, Montana and Utah — hope to do so this month or next.In Mississippi and Alaska, everyone age 16 or older is eligible, and Arizona and Michigan have made the vaccines available to all adults in some counties.
