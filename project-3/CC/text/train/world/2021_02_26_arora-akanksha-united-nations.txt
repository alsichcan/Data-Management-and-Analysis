Who Is Arora Akanksha, the 34-Year-Old Running for U.N. Secretary General?
UNITED NATIONS — Never mind that Arora Akanksha has worked at the United Nations for only about four years, as an auditor recruited from an accounting firm. Put aside that at age 34, she has no diplomatic experience.And forget that she is less than half as old as the incumbent she wants to replace, Secretary General António Guterres, 71, the veteran Portuguese statesman and former U.N. High Commissioner for refugees.Ms. Arora — she uses her family name first and prefers to be called Arora — said that as a grandchild of people who were once refugees, she was acutely aware of difficult odds.But with a $30,000 campaign budget drawn largely from her savings, a website and a social media promotion that begins with, “people in my profession aren’t supposed to stand up to the ones in charge,” Ms. Arora has declared herself a candidate to be the next leader of the United Nations.
