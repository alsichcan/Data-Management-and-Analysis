Italy Looks to Mario Draghi to Solve Crisis, to Delight of Pro-E.U. Politicians
ROME — The high-stakes negotiations to resolve Italy’s political crisis in the midst of a pandemic took a remarkable turn on Tuesday evening when the country’s president summoned Mario Draghi, the former head of the European Central Bank, to begin talks to form a new government.The development all but officially sounded the death knell on the tenure of Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, a previously unknown lawyer who had managed, with great ideological dexterity, to survive as Italy’s leader for more than two years and two governments, the first an alliance of hard-right nationalists and anti-establishment populists, the second with populists and the center-left establishment.Mr. Conte’s coalition government, which had brought together the populist Five Star Movement and the center-left Democratic Party, collapsed last month when a once-popular former prime minister and ex-leader of the Democratic Party, Matteo Renzi, pulled the support of his small but essential party, Italia Viva.Mr. Renzi, an ambitious politician unsatisfied with Mr. Conte’s performance and bothered by his cold shoulder, argued that the coalition government’s incompetence, undemocratic tendencies and lingering populist reluctance to use all the bailout funds made available by the European Union risked exacerbating the damage of Italy’s already catastrophic Covid crisis.
