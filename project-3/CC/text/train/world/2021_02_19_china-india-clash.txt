China Acknowledges 4 Deaths in Last Year’s Border Clash With India
When the senior Chinese officer on the ground, Qi Fabao, confronted the Indian soldiers high in the Himalayas last June, he was suddenly overwhelmed in a brawl fought with pipes, clubs and stones, according to the People’s Liberation Army of China.It said a battalion commander identified as Chen Hongjun led a charge of reinforcements to rescue him, in what became the deadliest clash in more than four decades along the tense mountainous border between China and India.The senior officer suffered a roughly four-inch gash across his forehead but survived. Chen Hongjun died, along with three other soldiers, the People’s Liberation Army’s Daily reported on Friday, in the most detailed official account of the battle so far. One of them was sucked under the churning current of the Galwan River, which rushes out of a valley at an elevation of nearly 14,000 feet.The account in the army’s official newspaper was China’s first explicit acknowledgment that its soldiers had died in the clash on June 15, the fiercest of a series of confrontations along contested parts of the border over the last eight months.
