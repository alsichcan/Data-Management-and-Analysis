True-Crime Podcast Puts Spotlight on Irish Coach Accused of Abuse
DUBLIN — Years of harrowing media reports in Ireland about alleged child abuse by a prominent swimming coach failed to prompt action from the Irish authorities, but now a true-crime podcast may help bring him home from exile in the United States.George Gibney, 72, is a former head coach of Ireland’s national and Olympic swimming teams, and is the subject of a popular podcast that prompted at least 18 of his former swimmers to come forward with new claims he abused them, according to the show’s producers.Mr. Gibney avoided trial in 1994 on 27 charges of rape and sexual abuse, against young male and female swimmers, when an Irish appeals court ruled in favor of his claim that the charges, relating to alleged incidents between 1967 and 1981, were too old and lacking in detail to allow him to defend himself properly.Shortly afterward, he moved to the United States on an immigrant visa he obtained before his indictment. He lives in Altamonte Springs, near Orlando, Fla.
