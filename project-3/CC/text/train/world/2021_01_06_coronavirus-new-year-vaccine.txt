‘I Will Get Up’: A Hard New Year Greets a World in Waiting
ROME — At midnight on New Year’s Eve, Stefania Giardoni popped a bottle of prosecco and bid good riddance to 2020, when she was hospitalized for months with the coronavirus and lost her job. As the Roman sky erupted in fireworks, she made no wish — “because last time we made wishes we had this damned pandemic.”But 2021 brought her more bad news anyway. She can’t get a doctor’s appointment for her joint pain because hospitals are again packed with Covid patients. Lockdowns and lack of business forced her son to shutter his shop for good. Bank officials have come seeking unpaid loans. “The New Year is already a tragedy,” she said.People around the world counted down to the end of 2020 with relish, pegging their hopes on the idea that the New Year would bring vaccines and something that felt like normalcy. But the coronavirus keeps no calendar. It has kept doing what it does: spreading, killing, sowing grief.
