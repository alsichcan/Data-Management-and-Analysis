Australian Politician Loses Court Fight Over Twisted Sister Song
An Australian politician was ordered on Friday to pay Universal Music more than $1 million for using the Twisted Sister song “We’re Not Gonna Take It” in his party’s advertising.The politician, Clive Palmer, who is a billionaire mining magnate, had argued in court that the lyrics of the song used in 2019 election advertising for his United Australia Party, with thrashing guitars and the line “Australia ain’t gonna cop it,” were his own original work.But the band objected strongly after fans asked them about the advertisements on Twitter, and Universal Music, which owns the rights to “We’re Not Gonna Take It,” launched copyright infringement proceedings against Mr. Palmer in Australia’s Federal Court.In a ruling on Friday, Justice Anna Katzmann rejected Mr. Palmer’s claims about the song, labeling parts of his account “ludicrous” and “fanciful.”
