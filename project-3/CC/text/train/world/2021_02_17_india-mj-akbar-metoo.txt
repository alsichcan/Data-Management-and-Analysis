Indian Court Clears Journalist of Defamation Claim in #MeToo Case
NEW DELHI — A court in New Delhi on Wednesday acquitted an Indian journalist of defamation after she accused M.J.

But the court found that Mr. Akbar failed to prove his case, saying Ms. Ramani’s disclosure was in the interest of preventing sexual harassment in the workplace.The court said in its order that the “right of reputation can’t be protected at the cost of right to dignity.”“I feel vindicated on behalf of all the women who have ever spoken up on sexual harassment in the workplace,” Ms. Ramani told reporters outside the courtroom.
