Data Recorder Recovered From Indonesian Plane Crash
Indonesian Navy divers have recovered the flight data recorder from Sriwijaya Air Flight 182, which crashed into the Java Sea shortly after takeoff on Saturday with 62 people aboard, officials said Tuesday.Remains of some of the victims were also brought ashore in dozens of body bags, officials said. So far, four victims have been identified. No survivors from the flight are expected to be found.The quick recovery of the flight data recorder, sometimes known as a “black box” and one of two on the aircraft, will help officials understand why the 26-year-old Boeing 737-500 crashed just four minutes after takeoff from Jakarta, the capital. The plane was bound for Pontianak on the island of Borneo, a flight of about 90 minutes.The divers retrieved the flight data recorder from the wreckage in about 75 feet of water between the small islands of Lancang and Laki, officials said.
