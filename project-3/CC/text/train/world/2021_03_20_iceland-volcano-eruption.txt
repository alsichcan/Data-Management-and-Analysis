A Volcano Erupted in Iceland. Björk Was ‘Sooo Excited.’
A volcano erupted in Iceland on Friday, essentially turning the night sky into a real-life lava lamp.No injuries were reported. Just joy — and the odd traffic jam.The eruption occurred on Friday evening near Mount Fagradalsfjall, about 20 miles southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, the Icelandic Meteorological Office said on Twitter. The agency said that the lava fountains were small by volcano standards, and that seismometers were not recording much turbulence.“It’s a small eruption flowing from a small fissure,” said Páll Einarsson, a professor emeritus of geophysics at the University of Iceland, about the fissure. “It’s quite harmless and we don’t expect any damage, not even ash clouds that could disrupt flight traffic.”Mr. Einarsson said experts could not predict how the eruption would evolve, but the meteorological office said on Saturday that the volcanic activity had already decreased.
