Japanese Student Forced to Dye Her Hair Black Wins, and Loses, in Court
Like many schools in Japan, where most people are born with straight, black hair, the Kaifukan Senior High School in Osaka is fussy about studentsâ€™ appearances. Perms and braided extensions are off limits, as are dyed and bleached hair.One brown-haired Japanese-born student ran into trouble when school officials, believing that she had flouted the rules, checked her roots and repeatedly demanded that she dye it black. Though the student dyed her hair at first, she eventually stopped complying.The school then removed her desk from the classroom, erased her name from school rosters and barred her from a school trip. In 2017, when the student was 18, she sued the Osaka Prefecture, which runs the school, alleging mental distress.On Tuesday, the District Court of Osaka ordered the local government to pay her $3,100 in emotional damages. The student had originally sought $20,780 in damages.
