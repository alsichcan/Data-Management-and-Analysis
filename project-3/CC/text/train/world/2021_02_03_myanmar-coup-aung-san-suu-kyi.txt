After Coup, Myanmar Military Charges Aung San Suu Kyi With Obscure Infraction
Two days after Myanmar’s military seized power in a coup, the scope of its formal allegations against the country’s civilian leader, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, are taking shape: She is accused of illegally importing at least 10 walkie-talkies. It was a bizarre postscript to a fraught 48 hours in which the army placed the country’s most popular leader back under house arrest and extinguished hopes that the Southeast Asian nation could one day serve as a beacon of democracy in a world awash with rising authoritarianism.The surprise use of walkie-talkies to justify locking up a Nobel Peace Prize laureate reinforced the military’s penchant for using fine-grained strategy to neutralize its greatest political rival. The accusations, which surfaced in a court order on Wednesday, may seem obscure and underwhelming, but they could put her in prison for up to three years. The court order to detain Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, which was provided by an official from her party, the National League for Democracy, was dated on the day of the coup and authorized her detention for 15 days. The document said soldiers searching her villa in Naypyidaw, the capital, had turned up various pieces of communications equipment that had been brought into the country without proper paperwork.
