Transgender Woman Expelled From South Korean Army Is Found Dead
SEOUL, South Korea â€” A transgender woman who was expelled by the South Korean military last year after her gender-reassignment surgery has been found dead at her home south of Seoul, the police said on Thursday.The authorities said they were investigating the cause of death of the woman, Byeon Hee-su, 23, whose body was found on Wednesday at her home in the city of Cheongju by emergency responders. They were alerted after a local mental health center that had been counseling her reported that it could not contact her.Ms. Byeon, who had been a staff sergeant in an army tank unit, was discharged from the military in January 2020 following her surgery. She had wanted to continue her service in the army, but a military panel declared her unfit to serve. She became the first active-duty soldier in South Korea to be referred to such a panel because she had had a sex-change operation.Since her dismissal, Ms. Byeon had campaigned vigorously to be reinstated, arguing that there was no reason she could not fulfill her duties.
