Another French Intellectual Falls After Comments on Abuse Accusations
PARIS — A leading French television news network has fired Alain Finkielkraut, one of the country’s most prominent public intellectuals, for suggesting there may have been a rush to judgment in the downfall this month of a leading political scientist accused of sexually abusing his teenage stepson.Mr. Finkielkraut, 71, was asked to discuss the case of Olivier Duhamel, 70, who last week quit his university and media posts after the accusations surfaced in a book. He began by telling the network, LCI, that Mr. Duhamel had committed “a reprehensible act,” adding that, “What he did was very serious, it was inexcusable.”Later, however, Mr. Finkielkraut, a member of the revered Académie Française, embarked on a series of musings. “Was there consent? At what age did this begin? Was there some form of reciprocity?” When the interviewer reminded him that the case involved “a 14-year-old child,” he said: “And so? We are talking about an adolescent, it’s not the same thing.”A social media explosion ensued. Adrien Taquet, the secretary of state for the protection of children, tweeted: “What world do you live in, Alain Finkielkraut? Are you really talking about consent between an adolescent and a member of his family?”
