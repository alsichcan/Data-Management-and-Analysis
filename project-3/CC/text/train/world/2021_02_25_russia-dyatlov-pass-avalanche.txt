Is ‘Avalanche’ the Answer to a 62-Year-Old Russian Mystery Over 9 Deaths?
MOSCOW — What drove nine experienced hikers, some barefoot and almost naked, out of their tent and into the subzero cold and the tomblike darkness of the Russian wilderness in 1959?When their bodies were found in a remote pass in the Ural Mountains, 62 years ago this week, no one could explain what — or who — had killed them.That riddle has baffled investigators and inspired books, movies and TV shows for decades, but now, two scientists believe they may finally have found an answer.For some Russians, the enduring mystery has taken on the qualities of a national legend, which some call “Dyatlovmania,” after the leader of the group of young hikers, Igor Dyatlov. It’s an obsession that mixes rational research and wild conspiracy theories, some involving U.F.O.s or yeti.
