Madrid Mayor Says Snowstorm Caused Nearly $2 Billion in Damage
MADRID — Madrid’s mayor on Thursday called on the central government to declare Spain’s capital a disaster zone, warning that the damage caused by last weekend’s snowstorm would cost at least 1.4 billion euros, or $1.7 billion, to fix.Mayor José Luis Martínez-Almeida told a news conference that the disaster designation would release emergency funds and ensure that “all the people who have suffered damages can be compensated as quickly as possible.”Madrid has been struggling to reopen its streets to traffic and clear the piles of snow, which covered the city on Friday and Saturday. The storm, named Filomena, brought the heaviest snowfall Madrid has seen in almost 50 years, dropping more than a foot and a half of snow on the 6.6 million people who live in the city and the surrounding region.
