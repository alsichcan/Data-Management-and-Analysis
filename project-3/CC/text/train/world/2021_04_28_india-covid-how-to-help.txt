How to Help India Amid the Covid Crisis
India’s coronavirus crisis is the worst since the pandemic began, and it will probably worsen before it gets better.Hospitals are full, oxygen supplies are dwindling, and sick people are dying as they wait to see doctors. As workers leave locked-down cities for their home villages, experts fear that the exodus could accelerate the spread of the virus in rural areas, as a similar one did last year.Official estimates of the nationwide infection toll — well above 300,000 a day — are probably undercounted, epidemiologists say. The reported figure will mostly likely rise to 500,000 cases a day by August, they say, leaving as many as one million of India’s 1.4 billion people dead from Covid-19.Charities, volunteers and businesses in India and beyond are trying to help the country’s Covid victims and frontline workers.
