Canadian Lawmaker Apologizes for Taking Nude Photo of Colleague
A member of Canada’s House of Commons apologized on Wednesday for having taken a nude photo of one of his colleagues during a Zoom call, an episode that prompted mockery, anger and calls for an investigation after the image circulated widely on social media.The lawmaker, Sébastien Lemire, a member of the Bloc Québécois, acknowledged having taken the photo of William Amos, a Liberal Party member from Quebec, when Mr. Amos appeared nude on Zoom during a legislative session last week. Mr. Lemire said he did not know how the photo had ended up on social media.Mr. Amos had said he had been changing into his work clothes after a jog and had been unaware that the camera on his computer was on. Although other lawmakers who were logged into a private Zoom call could see Mr. Amos standing naked between the flags of Canada and Quebec, the video was not streamed publicly because Mr. Amos was not speaking at the time.
