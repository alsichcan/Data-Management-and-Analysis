Beneath Her Decorous Demeanor, ‘Lady Bird Johnson’ Was a Political Force
LADY BIRD JOHNSON Hiding in Plain SightBy Julia SweigWe should all be so lucky as to have a Claudia Taylor, a.k.a. Lady Bird Johnson, in our lives, someone with the self-effacing graciousness of a geisha, the political shrewdness of Cleopatra, the intelligence of a Phi Beta Kappa and the caregiving skills of Florence Nightingale. Without someone with the former first lady’s considerable gifts, the expansive yet explosive 36th president, Lyndon B. Johnson, might have found himself far less effective, while, owing mostly to the times, Lady Bird’s own aspirations had to be channeled through his. Maybe this wasn’t so bad, given that L.B.J. was, from November 1963 to January 1969, the most powerful man on the planet.Reading between the lines of Julia Sweig’s extensive, engaging new biography, “Lady Bird Johnson: Hiding in Plain Sight,” it is possible to see her as the perfect bridge to the modern first lady — not the visionless helpmeet of a Nancy Reagan, but not quite the fully realized, independent role models of Hillary Clinton or Michelle Obama. To paraphrase the former Texas Governor Ann Richards, Lady Bird did everything more recent first ladies did, but “backwards and in high heels.”
