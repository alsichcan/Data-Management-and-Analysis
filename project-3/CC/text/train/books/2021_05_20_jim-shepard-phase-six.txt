From the Ice of Greenland, a Deadly Virus and a Familiar Doom
PHASE SIXBy Jim ShepardThe publication of “Phase Six” is one of those moments of synchronicity that make you wonder if an author is capable of precognition. It brought to my mind Chris Cleave’s novel about a terror attack in London, “Incendiary,” which was published on July 7, 2005 — the day of a terror attack in London. It also recalls Morgan Robertson’s 1898 book “The Wreck of the Titan,” which describes a passenger liner sinking after colliding with an iceberg in the North Atlantic — 14 years before the disaster of the Titanic.Jim Shepard’s new novel describes the genesis and spread of a deadly pandemic that arises in one of the world’s remote corners and goes on to upend life everywhere, exposing inadequacies in governments and health care systems, and revealing the heroism of ordinary people. Vivid and carefully researched, it’s clearly the product of long and conscientious work. It lands uncannily now, since at some point during its gestation, real life caught up with the book’s speculative world.Of course, the skeptic is right to point out that spooky-seeming coincidences are easily explained: Terrorists carry out attacks and boats sink with depressing frequency. Once in a while, their timing will make a book seem eerily prescient. And one of the things that “Phase Six” insists on is that no gift of prophecy was required to foresee a global pandemic. Shepard reminds us that back in 2006, 90 percent of epidemiologists were predicting a major pandemic within two generations. The inevitability of an outbreak is a recurring and vivid theme in the book. Pathogens are older, more resilient and more adaptable than we are. “Who would you put your money on?” asks one of Shepard’s scientists, chillingly. “Humans have been around for what, 200,000 years? And bacteria for like three and a half billion.”
