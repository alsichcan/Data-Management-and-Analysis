‘The Copenhagen Trilogy,’ a Sublime Set of Memoirs About Growing Up, Writing and Addiction
How does great literature — the Grade A, top-shelf stuff — announce itself to the reader?Nabokov spoke of the shiver between the shoulder blades. Emily Dickinson required more persuasion. “If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off,” she wrote in a letter, “I know that is poetry.”I’m sorry to say that I occasionally experience it as the dishonorable and squirrelly impulse to hoard the book in question, to keep it my secret. This can prove difficult, as you might imagine, given my line. All of which is to say, I bring news of Tove Ditlevsen’s suite of memoirs with the kind of thrill and reluctance that tells me this must be a masterpiece.The books first appeared in Denmark between 1967 and 1971 under the titles “Childhood” (“Barndom”), “Youth” (“Ungdom”) and “Dependency” (“Gift” — the Danish word for both the adjective “married” and the noun “poison”). The first two volumes were translated by Tiina Nunnally, the final one — the most sublime and harrowing — by Michael Favala Goldman. Now published together in one handsome volume as “The Copenhagen Trilogy,” they are a portrait of an artist and a portrait of an addict — and the product of a terrifying talent.Ditlevsen, who died in 1976, is beloved in her native Denmark; today her work is taught in schools and her life is the subject of reverent plays. Danish editions of her work often feature her photograph on the cover — her head cocked, a cigarette between her fingers, looking amused and conspiratorial. “Loved by generations of women and put down by generations of men,” the Danish writer Dorthe Nors has described her.
