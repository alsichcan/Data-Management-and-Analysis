Voyages of Hope and Anguish: New Science Fiction and Fantasy
In Karin Tidbeck’s THE MEMORY THEATER (Pantheon, 240 pp., $25.95), Dora and Thistle are children surviving together in a timeless place called the Gardens, where horrifically cruel lords and ladies live in an eternal twilight and torture their stolen child servants for sport before eventually killing and eating them. Thistle is trapped there by the theft of his name; Dora is trapped by a bad bargain and her devotion to Thistle. They love and protect each other like siblings, as best they can. But one day Thistle’s mistress — the especially vicious Augusta Prima — finds a timepiece in the woods, and sets off a chain of events that will see her and the children tumbling through realms and ever stranger stories.“The Memory Theater” is exquisite and astonishing. The prose has a sculpted precision, every sentence both tense as a watch spring and serene as a mountain. Tidbeck skips from horror to wonder to humor like a stone skimming water, and is equally nimble in managing characters; each one steps onto the page fully formed no matter how minor the role. There is Ghorbi, a mysterious trader and traveler; Pinax, an archivist who treats friendship with great solemnity; Nils Nilsson, a man hidden inside himself. And there is the Memory Theater, wheeled and wonderful, with its Director, Journeyman, Apprentice and others, who enact the many dramas of the world while traveling through a cosmological “backstage.”The tragedies at the book’s heart — the agonizing losses, the senseless cruelty — are somewhat mitigated by their parallels to folk and fairy tales, which offer the benefit of a certain distance; a murder is less appalling when encountered in a ballad, pinned into place by a refrain.
