Recasting ‘Riots’ as Black Rebellions
AMERICA ON FIREThe Untold History of Police Violence and Black Rebellion Since the 1960sBy Elizabeth HintonAmerica memorializes the civil rights movement’s modern era in sepia-toned images. Through the retrospective lens that valorizes this past even as it obscures essential aspects of it from the present, John Lewis, one of the peaceful demonstrators who faced down horrific violence as a Freedom Rider and on the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, was acknowledged by the end of his life as an icon of personal dignity and civic virtue.
