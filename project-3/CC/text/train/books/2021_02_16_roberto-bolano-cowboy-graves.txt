Roberto Bolaño Recenters His Mythic World
COWBOY GRAVESThree NovellasBy Roberto BolañoTranslated by Natasha WimmerEmily Dickinson asked her sister, Vinnie, to burn her papers after she died. For Kafka, it was his friend Max Brod. Philip Larkin assigned the job to a professional, the distinguished editor and poet Anthony Thwaite. But no formal code of ethics covers the work of literary executors, whose general inclination — when in doubt, publish — often leaves us the richer. True, it may not enlarge our sense of Larkin’s poems to read him banging on about his “non-acting bowels” (see: “Letters Home: 1937-1977”), but do we really want to live in a world where Dickinson’s fascicles or Kafka’s “Castle” get consigned to the flames?The case of the Chilean genius Roberto Bolaño (1953-2003) seems even more clear-cut. By his 40s, with his liver starting to fail, he was already mining his own archives to support his wife and children, beginning the work that continues long after his death. And why shouldn’t it? “The Savage Detectives” may have made Bolaño’s name, but his posthumous publications — from the galactic “2666” to the winsome “Spirit of Science Fiction” — have cemented his legend. He left behind a vault to rival Prince’s Paisley Park.Still, given the intricate recursions among the books he published in his lifetime — his love of mirrors and fractals and labyrinths, his gestures toward some Borgesian roman-fleuve — the bootleg feel of more recent editions has started to pose an aesthetic problem. It’s all well and good to speak of Bolaño’s “poetics of inconclusiveness” (to quote a peremptory note in “The Secret of Evil”), but how to discern those poetics when the work itself is so obviously unfinished?
