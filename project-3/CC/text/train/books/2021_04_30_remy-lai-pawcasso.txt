It’s a Dog’s Life — or Is It?
PAWCASSOBy Remy LaiAt first glance I assumed this graphic novel was about art. The title is a play on “Picasso,” and there’s a dog on the cover. Maybe the dog is a painter?Spoiler alert: He’s not. Nonetheless, follow him and you’ll soon be immersed in a skillfully woven story of acceptance and forgiveness.These concepts aren’t easy to present to a young audience in an upbeat way, but Remy Lai (“Pie in the Sky” and “Fly on the Wall”) succeeds: The dog provides both reliable comfort and comedic relief.Pets and babies always upstage their fellow actors, so let’s talk about the dog. Lai knows dogs! This book is filled with masterly drawings of the furry kind. My favorites include the dog’s map of the woods (great dog perspective) and the dog with a spa-day head wrap (truly adorable). The montage of the dog rolling in poop is wonderful. Yes, you read that correctly. There’s genuine happiness on that dog’s face. When it comes to artistic line and expression, the dog is a star.
