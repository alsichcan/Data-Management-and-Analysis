A Kid-Friendly Graphic Novel History of Vaccines
A SHOT IN THE ARM!By Don BrownThe history of vaccines is a deserving addition to Don Brown’s Big Ideas That Changed the World graphic nonfiction series, and the arrival of “A Shot in the Arm!” couldn’t be more timely. Narrated by Lady Mary Wortley Montagu (1689-1762), this fascinating and enlightening journey takes us around the world and introduces us to a range of scientific superstars of germ theory and vaccination development.Many lesser-known but key players are rescued from obscurity here. Though Cotton Mather received most of the credit for using variolation (a method of inoculating smallpox-naïve patients with tiny doses of smallpox through cuts in the skin) to save lives in 18th-century Massachusetts, it was Onesimus, an enslaved man from Africa (his home country is a matter of debate), who enlightened Mather about the well-known process performed in his home village. Likewise, you may have heard about the British physician Edward Jenner scratching cowpox blister liquid into the arm of a little boy to prevent full-blown smallpox, but a dairy farmer named Benjamin Jesty had successfully inoculated his own family with the liquid years earlier.Montagu — known within high society for her beauty — herself suffered the disfigurement of smallpox. Later, while living in Turkey, she learned of inoculation to protect her children, then spread the word throughout Britain upon her return.One of the book’s shining moments is a clever infographic depiction of how vaccines help antigens more efficiently fight certain pathogens. After personally explaining the concept to countless patients, I am thrilled to see it presented in such a simple, accurate and entertaining way.
