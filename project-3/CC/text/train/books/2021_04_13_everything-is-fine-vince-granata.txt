When Someone Says ‘Everything Is Fine,’ It Usually Isn’t
EVERYTHING IS FINE A MemoirBy Vince GranataTrouble comes to every family eventually. But what kind, and can you ever see it coming? It’s this, the ability to recognize and cope with crisis, that can mean the difference between life and death. Evasion might be easier — if you don’t acknowledge the dysfunction in the people you love, the delusion goes, then maybe you can avoid the loss, the grief. But it’s hard to summon compassion, or action, from beneath a hopeful fog.“Everything Is Fine” is the succinct and haunting title of Vince Granata’s imperfect memoir of how his brother Tim, suffering from schizophrenia, bound their mother’s wrists with duct tape one July afternoon in 2014 and killed her in the family room of their house in Orange, Conn., using two serrated knives and two sledgehammers. The rest of the family was out of the house that day, working, shopping, visiting friends. The author — then 27, a Yale graduate, an English teacher — was in the Dominican Republic, teaching children how to read.Tim had wrestled in high school at 270 pounds, and at 23, he was still gigantic, living at home, sleeping through the days and spending nights in the basement lifting weights while his psychosis was slowly dominating him. He saw coins floating before his eyes. He tossed salt on his parents as they slept. And he struggled, in his mind quite literally, with devils he communicated with via Google. On the morning of his mother’s death, he warned her that those devils were winning. “Something bad is going to happen,” he told her in the kitchen. “They are going to come for me. If something looks like a suicide, just know that I love you.” The lines between suicide and homicide blurred in Tim’s mind.
