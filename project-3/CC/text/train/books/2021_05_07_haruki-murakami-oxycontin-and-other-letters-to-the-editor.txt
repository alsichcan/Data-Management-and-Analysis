Haruki Murakami, OxyContin and Other Letters to the Editor
To the Editor: I really appreciated David Means’s review of Haruki Murakami’s new story collection, “First Person Singular” (April 25). Means is a good guide to discovering and appreciating Murakami’s oeuvre. And if you’ve never read any of it until now, this pithy collection is a good entry. But — you either get Haruki Murakami or you don’t. And if you don’t like this one, you won’t like anything else he wrote either.Murakami is that rare, once-in-a-generation writer who manages to either completely engross you in his world, at least in his abstract and arcane (but quite openly modern) musings on it, or to completely turn you off from turning even another page in any of his books. To me, “First Person Singular” was an opportunity to immerse myself yet again into his deftly woven magic.Of the stories in the book, “Confessions of a Shinagawa Monkey” (about carrying other people and the feelings they evoke within yourself) and the title story (about carrying around your personal hell, sometimes for the wrong reasons, sometimes innocently, but mostly not) are my favorites, and wonderful in reminding me why I like Murakami so much.Paula Zevin Somerset, N.J.To the Editor:In his review of Patrick Radden Keefe’s “Empire of Pain: The Secret History of the Sackler Dynasty” (April 25), John Carreyrou makes no mention of a major reason the Sacklers were so successful in selling OxyContin.
