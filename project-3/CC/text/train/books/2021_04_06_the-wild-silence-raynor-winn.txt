No Longer Homeless or Hiking, Raynor Winn Is Still in Thrall to Nature
THE WILD SILENCE By Raynor Winn“The Wild Silence” continues the story Raynor Winn began in her well-received 2019 memoir, “The Salt Path,” but one can enjoy the sequel on its own, for it includes a recap of the circumstances that caused Winn and her husband, Moth, both in their 50s, to lose the beloved farm in Wales where they had kept sheep, grown vegetables and raised a family. Soon after their eviction (following a financial dispute with a business partner and a lost court battle), Moth received a diagnosis of corticobasal degeneration, or CBD, a brain disease with no treatment or cure. Ignoring his doctor’s admonition to avoid tiring himself or walking too far, and with no home to return to, the couple took to the outdoors instead, embarking on a strenuous monthslong hike along the 630 miles of England’s South West Coast Path.This book opens with the couple living in a rented apartment in a Cornwall fishing village. Moth pursues a degree in sustainable horticulture, and Winn walks the seaside cliffs. From childhood she has chosen the company of grass, trees and wildlife over that of people. The wild has become her natural habitat, and she pitches the musty tent from their hike in their tiny bedroom in order to get the sleep she can no longer achieve on a mattress.Winn fears that her husband will not be able to finish his degree. And she knows that he needs to keep moving; against the odds, the exertions of hiking have kept his disease at bay. After one scan, a doctor tells them that his brain has found new pathways to preserve his cognition and mobility.
