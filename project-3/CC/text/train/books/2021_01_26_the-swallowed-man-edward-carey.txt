P.O.V.: You’re Geppetto, Missing Your Wooden Son From Inside the Belly of a Fish
THE SWALLOWED MAN By Edward CareyPinocchio endures; why, I’m not sure. Carlo Collodi’s original 19th-century fairy tale is often funny, but with its rambunctious wooden hero who can’t become “real” until he learns to behave, and who is further shamed by a phallic, lie-detecting nose, the story mixes morality and physiognomy in noxious, silly ways. Somehow, though, this mash-up of Mary Shelley and Cotton Mather has resonated for generations: Most everyone knows of Walt Disney’s very freely adapted 1940 film, but there have also been movie, TV and stage Pinocchios from the Czech Republic, Russia, Canada, France and Japan — and so many Italian Pinocchios that Roberto Benigni has managed to star in two. Sequels on page and screen have taken the puppet to America, Africa, outer space and the year 3000, while yet more are reported in the works from Guillermo Del Toro and Robert Zemeckis. Francis Ford Coppola fought for years to make his own version. Miraculously, Jerry Lewis never got the bug.Amid this glut, the novelist and playwright Edward Carey has had the inspired idea to cut the marionette loose and focus instead on Geppetto, the lonely old woodcutter who carves Pinocchio from an enchanted block of pine, giving him form and life — which is about as close as men get to immaculate conception, even in fantasy. Carey’s odd duck of a book is less a proper novel than a riff on the entwined themes of fatherhood and creative spark. Faithful to Collodi in outline if not in spirit, “The Swallowed Man” takes place inside the giant fish (not a whale, as in Disney) that swallows Geppetto after he sets off to sea in search of his runaway wooden offspring.
