This Time, He Stars In His Own Story
A year or so ago, Gabriel Byrne was putting the final touches on his memoir, “Walking With Ghosts,” a series of snapshots from his early life in Ireland and beyond, when he struck an errant key on his laptop.Poof! The screen went blank.“It was kind of devastating,” Byrne said in a video interview last month. “I went to the store where they have the geniuses” — that would be Apple, with its Genius Bar — “and I said, ‘I want your most genius Genius.’ And he said, ‘Unless you can get some kind of spy agency involved in this, it’s gone and we have no idea where it is.’”Luckily, Byrne found the book had more or less lodged itself into his unconscious, and he was able to resurrect it, writing in cafes, this time with an iPad and liberal use of the “save” function. Written as if its author were “an intruder in my own past,” as Byrne put it, “Walking With Ghosts” is being published by Grove Press on Tuesday. The writer Colum McCann calls it “a book that will wring out our tired hearts.”Now 70 and with a long and growing list of television, movie and stage credits to his name, Byrne has spent most of the pandemic at his house on a hill in Rockport, Maine, with his wife, Hannah Beth King, a documentary filmmaker, and their young daughter. (He has two older children with his first wife, the actor Ellen Barkin, and also has an apartment in Manhattan.) Rockport is the sort of place, he said, where no one much cares what he does for work.
