The Show Is About to Begin, Onstage and in the Audience’s Minds
THE PERFORMANCEBy Claire ThomasThe effects of the Covid-19 pandemic include a sense of temporal partition: There is a distinct before and after, a dividing line between past and present, social proximity and distance, life lived in person and through a screen. TV shows that depict unmasked people are jarring, relics of a bygone world — or, at the very least, a world put indefinitely on hold.“The Performance" — the second novel by the Australian writer Claire Thomas, though the first to be published in the United States — is both appropriately existential for this cultural moment and far enough behind it to evoke nostalgic recognition. On a summer night, as bush fires rage outside, three women converge in a Melbourne theater to watch a performance of Samuel Beckett’s “Happy Days.” (Who among us does not wince to remember a time when hundreds of people could sit in a darkened theater, when the sound of a cough was cause for mere annoyance instead of alarm?)Two of these women are audience members: Ivy, a philanthropist raising a young son after terrible loss, and Margot, a college professor contending with the illness that has made her husband a stranger. The third, Summer — an usher and acting student — is torn between her duties at the theater and mounting fear for her girlfriend, April, whose family is defending their mountainside home from the blaze.
