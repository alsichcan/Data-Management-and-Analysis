From Cape Cod to Martha’s Vineyard to the Caribbean, These Beach Reads Will Whisk You Into Summer
THAT SUMMERBy Jennifer Weiner432 pp. Atria. $28.Weiner, the undisputed boss of the beach read, is back with another stunner. Part mystery and part love story, with a strong dash of coming-of-age, “That Summer” welcomes readers into the lives of Diana “Daisy” Shoemaker, her teenage daughter, Beatrice, and Diana Starling, the glamorous corporate consultant whose emails mistakenly land in Daisy’s inbox.In her early 20s, Daisy put her own aspirations on hold to marry a wealthy, domineering, to-the-manner-born lawyer, Hal Shoemaker, who still defines himself by his years at an elite New Hampshire boarding school. Even after decades of marriage, Daisy exists on the periphery of Hal’s world, a homemaker whose efforts are occasionally appreciated but never admired.Diana’s misplaced emails offer a glimpse into a life of glitz and independence in a time when Daisy’s life feels particularly small. While Daisy’s cooking, cleaning and coaxing monosyllables out of her teenage daughter, Diana is jetting off to tennis tournaments and celebrating birthdays with spa weekends in Marin County. Soon the two women strike up an unlikely friendship, but the reader suspects that Diana is keeping secrets — big ones. You don’t have to be a detective to see that more connects her to Daisy than their shared first name. While the mystery’s grand reveal is fairly obvious, the getting there is fraught with tension and twists that keep the pages turning furiously.Weiner’s book is less concerned with what happened that summer on the Cape than with how the impact of that event has ricocheted wildly across the years, coloring the lives of Diana, Daisy and now Beatrice. It’s a thoughtful approach that allows characters depth and complexity, rather than reducing any one of them to a singular moment of trauma.
