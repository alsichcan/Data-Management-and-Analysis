One Novel. Three Generations. All of Life’s Challenges and Joys.
THE RECENT EASTBy Thomas GrattanIt’s a unique, if common, cruelty to transplant a child who is just putting down roots. For those pulled and relocated, there’s a thirstiness — and a little guarded ring of bark — that those with stable childhoods lack. In “The Recent East,” a wonderful, immersive debut novel from the writer and teacher Thomas Grattan, we’re given an intimate look at these wood cuttings, as seen through three generations of one family, each moved across an ocean just before blooming.In 1968, Beate is 12. Germany is divided by the Berlin Wall and she lives in the East with her family, but her parents have acquired fake passports and intend to defect — first to West Germany, then England, then the United States. At the border, they tell the soldiers they are “returning” after visiting an ill cousin. Upset at leaving home, Beate is tempted to tell the truth, just to spite her parents. Yet she stays quiet and becomes a defector — a new kernel of identity her English and American teachers, classmates and friends want her to lean into: “There was nothing like trauma survived to let others remember for a while that their boredom was a luxury.” Having escaped communism makes Beate “interesting” — and lonely.
