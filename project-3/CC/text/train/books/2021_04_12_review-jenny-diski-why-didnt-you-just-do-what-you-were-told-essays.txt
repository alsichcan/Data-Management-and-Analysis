Prime Cuts From Jenny Diski’s Catalog of Intimate, Witty Essays
Herman Tarnower, the murdered diet-book writer, tried to class up his offices in Scarsdale by strewing them with British publications. It didn’t seem to have worked.It remains, however, a nearly infallible way to choose a psychiatrist in Manhattan: If there aren’t copies of the LRB (London Review of Books), the TLS (Times Literary Supplement) or the NYRB (New York Review of Books), or ideally all three, on the waiting room table, you back slowly out the door. Their display signals seriousness of intent.In such waiting rooms, I’ve always picked up The London Review of Books first because I knew I had a friend there. Her name was Jenny Diski.Amid the book reviews in the LRB by critics determined to sound sober and certain, as if they were museum docents, her reviews and essays admitted doubt. They were marvelously shrewd but approachable and witty. Diski’s articles made the sound of someone chewing her fingernails very intelligently. She made stuffy waiting rooms a little brighter.
