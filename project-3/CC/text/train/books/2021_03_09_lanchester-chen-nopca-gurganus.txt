Short Story Collections for an Ever-Changing World
REALITY AND OTHER STORIESBy John Lanchester178 pp. Norton. $26.95.This intriguing debut collection grapples with technology and its illusion of convenience, choice and escape. Lanchester, a British novelist and journalist, has a sharp eye for social class and setting in his ghost stories for the digital age.“Which of These Would You Like?” portrays the absurdity and horror of incarceration. The narrator repeatedly asks, “Why am I here?” Rather than answer, his captors order him each day to select from a brochure of handcuffs, scaffolds and hoods to prepare for his own execution. “This is all about you. You’re in control. You’re in control of everything!” a guard says, in chilling doublespeak not unlike the tech companies that promise privacy even as they collect and mine your data.Several stories begin energetically, with a catchy premise, but may leave some readers wanting more: A haughty academic encounters cursed audiobooks, a clerk receives a cursed selfie stick, a reality show contestant struggles to gain her footing and a woman flees haunted telephones.
