Under the Most Difficult Circumstances, Kindness Prevails
NO HEAVEN FOR GOOD BOYSBy Keisha BushWhen 6-year-old Ibrahimah is told by his older cousin Étienne that good Muslims get 72 virgins when they arrive in Paradise, the boy asks, “What’s a virgin?”“A girl,” Étienne answers.Ibrahimah thinks about this. He doesn’t want to live with 72 girls in Paradise; after all, he and Étienne barely have enough to feed themselves here on earth: “How is having to share food with 72 girls a reward for being good?”“No Heaven for Good Boys,” Keisha Bush’s unflinching and poignant debut novel, explores the meager rewards and harsh trials of these young talibé in Senegal. (As Bush explains in an author’s note, talibé are boys who study the Quran at residential schools with teachers known as marabouts.) In Dakar, where the novel is set, Ibrahimah and Étienne are dispatched by their marabout to beg for money, food, rice or sugar. If they don’t make their increasingly higher quotas, they are beaten and abused.Bush writes that she based her novel on observations made during the four years she lived and worked in Dakar; that authenticity rings through the book. We look through Bush’s eyes: “No one can mistake the sight of a talibé: the economy-sized red tin tomato can, bare callused feet, shaved heads patched with eczema, skinny bodies and faces of children without love.” These children are deprived of sufficient food and medical care, left to sleep on “ratty pieces of cardboard” while they listen to Marabout Ahmed abuse Étienne, whose “howls of pain diminish to grunts, then a low whimper.”
