New Thrillers That Glitter With Malice
If there is ever a time when you feel insane — sleepless, hormonal, weepy, terrified — it’s when you’re a new mother alone with your baby. So Megan, the young mother who narrates Julia Fine’s bonkers, provocative  THE UPSTAIRS HOUSE (HarperCollins, 304 pp., $26.99) is not all that surprised when, her nerves already frayed, she discovers that a turquoise door has appeared in her house and that a long-dead woman has taken up residence behind it.Oddly, the woman turns out to be Margaret Wise Brown, the author of classic children’s books like “The Runaway Bunny” and “Goodnight Moon” — and the subject of Megan’s unfinished Ph.D. thesis. Megan seems to have blundered into an epic struggle between Margaret and her real-life lover, Michael Strange, a poet, suffragist, femme fatale and provocateur who tortured Margaret emotionally when they were together and now seems to be threatening Megan’s baby.Things are weird enough anyway. Megan’s postpartum body feels clunky, achy, lumpy, leaky; she has what appear to be dissociative episodes. Michael (she thinks) is making her displeasure known by turning on the gas, flooding the bathroom and tossing ice cubes around the kitchen. Megan consults an internet forum for new mothers. “Does anyone else feel like someone they can’t see is watching them?” she asks.This assured, beautifully written book runs away with itself toward the end, as Fine ambitiously relates the tale of Margaret and Michael as well as the story of Megan and her baby, but it’s a bracing reminder that postpartum life is a kind of horror story of its own.
