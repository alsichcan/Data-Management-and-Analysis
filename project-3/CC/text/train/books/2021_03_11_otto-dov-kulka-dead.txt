Otto Dov Kulka, 87, Dies; Studied, and Witnessed, the Holocaust
Otto Dov Kulka, at 31, was the youngest survivor of Auschwitz to testify in 1964 when two decades of German failure to reckon with the Holocaust ended with the trial in Frankfurt of nearly two dozen former SS officers who had served at that extermination camp.He delivered a moving account of how Jewish inmates had sung Hebrew hymns before being loaded onto trucks that would convey them to the gas chambers, how at 9 years old he escaped the mass execution of his mother and all the friends who had been deported with him from Czechoslovakia because he had been ill and was quarantined in the camp’s medical block.But for nearly the next 50 years, as a historian of the Holocaust at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem, he would resist letting his personal experiences color his scholarship. Only in 2013 would he finally reveal them, in a haunting memoir titled “Landscapes of the Metropolis of Death: Reflections on Memory and Imagination” (translated into English from the original Hebrew by Ralph Mandel).“Few are aware of the existence within me of a dimension of silence,” he wrote, “of a choice I made to sever the biographical from the historical past.”
