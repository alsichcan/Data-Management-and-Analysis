Leonora Carrington’s Transformative Surrealist Novel
THE HEARING TRUMPETBy Leonora CarringtonI’ve never had a go-to answer for when someone asks, “What’s a great Surrealist novel?” I’ve always found this nearly century-old subgenre of literature rather tame, less a transcendence of the known world than half-baked psychoanalytic play and veiled romance. Real life is forever lurking around the corner, so it seems, lording its narrativizing ways over what might be glimpsed of the Beyond.Enter Leonora Carrington (1917-2011), a British-born Mexican painter and author who fantastically surpasses her Freud-struck, phallocentric contemporaries. Her 1974 novel, “The Hearing Trumpet,” newly reissued, stands out as something at last truly radical, undoing not only our expectations of time and space, but of the psyche and its boundaries.“For the last 45 years I have been trying to get away,” our 92-year-old narrator, Marian Leatherby, tells us early on. She knows she’s a liability to her son, Galahad, and his family, who live only for themselves. Nearly deaf, she is gifted a hearing trumpet by her friend Carmella — just in time to overhear her family discuss shipping her off to an elder-care institution “financed by a prominent American cereal company (Bouncing Breakfast Cereals Co.)” and portentously known as the Well of Light Brotherhood.
