Aliens, Book Organizing Tricks and Other Letters to the Editor
To the Editor:Dennis Overbye’s review of Avi Loeb’s “Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth” (Feb. 7), which identifies the celestial apparition Oumuamua as evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth, is poignant and evocative of other quests (since the Tower of Babel) to communicate with the cosmos and its forces.There is perhaps a more grounded interest in Loeb’s journey as the son of Holocaust refugees from a farm in Israel to astrophysics at Harvard and extraterrestrial yearnings. That is a book I would eagerly read.Hillel GrossmanBronx♦To the Editor:I thoroughly enjoyed Dennis Overbye’s review of Avi Loeb’s book. I share Loeb’s sense of wonder in the mysterious object Oumuamua as well as his conviction that, as Overbye puts it, “the discovery of alien life would be the greatest discovery in the history of science.” At the same time, it’s also worth noting the grave concerns expressed by thinkers like Stephen Hawking that an encounter with aliens could prove disastrous for our civilization. They could be both hostile and extremely powerful.Perhaps the aliens have similar reservations about us. Loeb predicts that when we finally do discover we’re not alone, “we will realize that we’ve spent more funds developing the means to destroy all life on the planet than it would have cost to preserve it.” This might be one reason that we haven’t heard from anyone yet.
