Margaret Maron, Acclaimed Mystery Writer, Dies at 82
Margaret Maron, whose crime fiction, much of it set in her native North Carolina, racked up mystery-writing awards and a devoted army of fans, died on Feb. 23 in hospice care in Raleigh, N.C. She was 82.Vicky Bijur, her longtime agent, said the cause was stroke-related illness.Ms. Maron was known for two series featuring strong female characters. The first, introduced in “One Coffee With” in 1981, was Sigrid Harald, a New York City police detective, who solved crimes and dealt with the obstacles of being a woman in what was at the time a largely male profession.Then, in 1992, came Deborah Knott, who in the initial novel, “Bootlegger’s Daughter,” was a legal aid lawyer running for a judgeship in North Carolina. By the second book she had become a judge, and as the series went along — it ultimately stretched to 20 books — Ms. Maron explored environmental stress, racial prejudice, domestic abuse and a host of other aspects of modern life in the state.“She’s old North Carolina and modern North Carolina,” the mystery writer Katy Munger, a fellow North Carolina resident, told The News & Observer of Raleigh in 2016. “You can chart the changes in North Carolina through her books.”
