Personal Canons, Foster Care and Other Letters to the Editor
To the Editor:In her review of Gabrielle Glaser’s “American Baby” (Jan. 24), Lisa Belkin asks what aspects of modern adoption will have profound and unexpected consequences. As an adoption counselor for the past 25 years, I believe some changes have been excellent, others detrimental.Unfortunately, in many states it’s illegal for adoptive parents to help with housing and food, even though many birth moms are homeless and hungry. Additionally, the heinous practice of babies bounced from one foster care family to another persists despite scientific research documenting the harm it causes.But adoptive parents go with their birth mother to the obstetrician, receive her medical records and are in the delivery room. And contact is one area contemporary adoption has gotten right. Knowing how important it is for their child, enlightened families exchange emails and social network information and often welcome visits from their birth mothers.Nancy Kors Walnut Creek, Calif.To the Editor: In his essay centered on Harold Bloom’s “The Bright Book of Life” (Jan. 31), Robert Gottlieb suggests that Bloom included Ursula K. Le Guin’s books among his favorites because of “personal considerations,” specifically Bloom and Le Guin’s friendship near the end of her life.
