Her Book Is About Belonging. She’s Struggling With the Idea.
At a sleepover in sixth grade, when she admitted that she hadn’t seen the movie “Grease,” Sanjena Sathian remembers being asked if she was even American.“I instinctively said, ‘No, I’m not,’ even though I was born here,” Sathian, now 29, said in a video interview from her home in Atlanta. That was typical for much of her life where she, like many South Asian Americans, was made to feel differently.It took her years to overcome that sense of otherness, but by the time she was preparing for the release of her debut novel, “Gold Diggers,” she felt confident calling herself an American.All that changed in an instant a few weeks ago, after eight people, including six women of East Asian descent, were killed by a gunman not far from the upper middle class Atlanta suburb where she grew up. The shootings felt close to home for Sathian, both physically and metaphorically.
