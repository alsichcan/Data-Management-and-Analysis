Pick Your Poison: The Sweet, Sometimes Lethal Sides of Your Produce
THE BOOK OF DIFFICULT FRUIT Arguments for the Tart, Tender, and Unruly (With Recipes) By Kate LeboI’ve been thinking about how to murder a man with cherry pits. Pie, definitely. I’d pit a few pounds of cherries, then smash the pits and mix with vodka into an almondlike, but poisonous, extract. The chemical compounds in the pits would react with his stomach acid to create bootleg cyanide. It’d take, I estimate, three whole pies for me to pull this off, but still. As Kate Lebo explores in “The Book of Difficult Fruit,” within the plant kingdom, there lurk so many potential killers.My cherry obsession aside, this darkly funny encyclopedia-memoir-essay collection is not a witch’s guide to killing your man. Each chapter takes on a different prickly, stinky, tricky, troublesome fruit — its history and usage in herbalism, its flavor and appeal, its dangers and difficulties — and ends with recipes. “In this book, fruit is not the smooth-skinned, bright-hued, waxed and edible ovary of the grocery store,” Lebo writes in the introduction (waxed ovary!): “What nurtures and what harms are entangled.” I turned the page so fast I got a paper cut.“Deeply researched” doesn’t begin to describe how far into ancient texts and their subtexts, obscure cookbooks and corners of the internet Lebo excavated to tell us the stories of these fruits. What she digs up for each is often fascinating, sometimes juicy, rarely dry. She interviews experts, including LaRae Wiley, a member of the Colville Confederated Tribes, on picking huckleberries, and Dale from Poison Control (for obvious reasons). In the standout juniper chapter, Lebo searches for evidence that women drank juniper tonics to terminate pregnancies and finds it in an herbalist’s guide from 1597 (“Gerard’s Herbal” claimed the plant’s “leaves, when ‘boyled in Wine and drunke,’ can … ‘expel the dead childe, and kill the quicke’”).
