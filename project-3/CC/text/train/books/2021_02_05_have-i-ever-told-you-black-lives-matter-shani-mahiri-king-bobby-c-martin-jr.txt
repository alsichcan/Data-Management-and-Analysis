2 Picture Books Celebrate the Poetry and Promise of Black Lives
HAVE I EVER TOLD YOU BLACK LIVES MATTERWritten by Shani Mahiri KingIllustrated by Bobby C. Martin Jr.THE ABCS OF BLACK HISTORYWritten by Rio CortezIllustrated by Lauren SemmerThe week I wrote this review, Kamala Harris became the first woman, first African-American and first Asian-American to take the oath of office as vice president of the United States. At the same event, Amanda Gorman, the nation’s first National Youth Poet Laureate, dazzled the world with her inaugural poem. Roughly two weeks before that, Bianca Smith joined the Red Sox organization, becoming the first Black woman hired to coach professional baseball. There will be more firsts before the sun sets on this day, and already Black authors and illustrators across the country are dreaming up ways to get these new accomplishments down on the page.But which breakthroughs should they include? No matter their choices, other equally worthy facts and personalities will have to be left out, and well-informed readers will call out sins of omission. Why include Augusta Savage but not Edmonia Lewis? Angela Davis but not Assata Shakur? Huey P. Newton but not Fred Hampton? These are never unreasonable questions, but a book can have only so many pages. Besides, the Black experience is so vast and multifaceted it can’t ever be contained within covers.Shani Mahiri King (an associate director of the Center on Race and Race Relations at the University of Florida, where he is also a law professor) addresses this dilemma directly in “Have I Ever Told You Black Lives Matter,” choosing to focus on the “collective” power in “the breadth and richness” of 116 individuals. They embody an impressive range, from the early American revolutionary Crispus Attucks to up-to-the-minute figures such as Jay-Z and Chadwick Boseman.
