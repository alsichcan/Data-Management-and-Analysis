Paul Theroux’s New Novel Takes On Life’s Crashing Waves
UNDER THE WAVE AT WAIMEABy Paul Theroux“Talk of books, here especially, seemed irrelevant,” Paul Theroux writes in “Under the Wave at Waimea,” his latest novel. “What was the point of mentioning these inert objects while on the beach, facing the moonlit sea flickering with chop and now and then a wave bursting in blackness offshore and crusted in white; these palms, this mild air and moonglow — it was all beyond books. People who did not have this beauty in their lives found some strange squirrelly indoor comfort in books.”Such are the ruminations of Joe Sharkey, the past-his-prime Hawaiian surfer who’s the protagonist of this book. But of course it’s Theroux himself who’s doing the verbal wave riding, leaping registers between the high-toned “mild air and moonglow” and the demotic “squirrelly.” Sharkey doesn’t even understand the lingo a onetime girlfriend uses, “words he could not spell and some he could barely pronounce: ‘fellatio,’ ‘polymorphous perversity,’ ‘rimming’ and ‘undinism.’ ‘What you just did?’ she would say … ‘It’s called irrumation.’” (To be fair, I had to look that last one up.) And when another character attributes the phrase “snot-green sea” to Joyce, Sharkey assumes he’s referring to a “surfer chick.”Even his creator talks over poor Sharkey’s head. “It was as if in surfing he was carving his name in water,” Theroux tells us. Sharkey, a fading local celebrity on the North Shore of Oahu, may not know Keats’s self-composed, self-pitying epitaph — “Here lies one whose name was writ in water” — but we do, don’t we? And in case we missed it the first time, here it comes again, 100 or so pages later: “Sharkey surfed every day … swiveling on the face of a wave as though carving his signature on it, writing on water.”
