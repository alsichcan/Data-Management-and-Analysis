For Caleb Azumah Nelson, There’s Freedom in Feeling Seen
Last December, Caleb Azumah Nelson visited Tate Britain to see “Fly in League With the Night,” an exhibit featuring the painter Lynette Yiadom-Boakye. In her portraits, he didn’t just see figures and backgrounds, he heard things too: the music of Miles Davis, Ebo Taylor, Solange — the songs the artist had been listening to as she conjured her characters.“A tradition of rhythm rendered on canvas in blues and greens, yellows and reds,” Azumah Nelson wrote in his review of the show. “In this way, it is possible to see something and to hear it too, and I wonder if this is what feeling is.”To read Azumah Nelson’s own fictional portrait — Black Cat, a Grove Atlantic imprint, releases his debut novel, “Open Water,” in the United States on Tuesday — is to sit with a similar kind of synesthesia. In prose interspersed with a Kendrick Lamar or A Tribe Called Quest lyric here, a scene from “Moonlight” or a Roy DeCarava photograph there, the unnamed narrator tells a story of falling in love, and then fighting to stay there.The narrator is a photographer who gets involved with his friend’s ex-girlfriend, a dancer, while they work together on a project to document Black life in London. Their relationship swells and evolves over the course of the book, but the narrator is also aware of the white world they inhabit, one where Black men and women are targeted by the police, where a patrol car follows him outside his own home. A world that makes the narrator afraid just to live, let alone love.
