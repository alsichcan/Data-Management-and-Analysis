Memoir by Amos Oz’s Daughter Divides Family and Shocks Israel
JERUSALEM — Amos Oz was one of Israel’s most celebrated authors, a humanist who used his words to pursue peace in a region wracked by conflict.So when his second daughter, Galia Oz, a children’s author and documentary filmmaker, released her own memoir this week, the opening lines could hardly have been more startling.“In my childhood, my father beat, cursed and humiliated me,” she wrote in Hebrew. “The violence was creative. He dragged me from inside the house and threw me out over the threshold. He told me I was filth. This was no passing loss of control or an occasional slap across the face, but a routine of sadistic abuse. My crime was me myself, so the punishment had no end. He needed to be sure I would break.”Mr. Oz, whose books included “My Michael,” “A Tale of Love and Darkness” and “Dear Zealots,” died of cancer in December 2018. Other family members, including his widow, Nili, his older daughter, Fania Oz-Salzberger, and his son, Daniel Oz, have come forward to defend him.
