Gary Panter’s Jagged, Shape-Shifting Antihero Was Made for Our Moment
“MEET GARY PANTER,” reads a 1988 ad in The Village Voice for a bookstore appearance in support of JIMBO: ADVENTURES IN PARADISE. The buff title character, cross-eyed and crew-cut, resembles an unhinged Billy Idol about to take the rugby pitch. “It’s an avant-garde adult comic book, about the adventures of a punk Everyman, who defines his generation,” the text claims. “Come by for a signed copy and meet a real comic book hero.”The public wasn’t biting, alas: Only one person showed up.Ad and anecdote appear in a new edition of Panter’s beautifully chaotic debut book (New York Review Comics, 103 pp., $29.95). They capture the wobbly position of comics as literature, 30-odd years ago: While Jimbo seethes in the advertisement, a photo of B. Dalton’s prim, bow-tied spokes-nerd smirks in the lower right corner, under the motto “You can call me ‘Books,’” as though marking his turf. Jimbo looks ready to give him a drubbing. The ad glosses over the prickly dissonance of Panter’s art, with its jagged textures, cutup logic and shape-shifting antihero.Panter was still a student at East Texas State University in the early 1970s when Jimbo first popped up unbidden in a comic story he was writing. A few years later, creator and creation met their moment in the Los Angeles punk scene. “Adventures in Paradise” was a decade in the making (1978-88), with parts originally appearing in the magazine Slash, The L.A. Reader and the seminal New York-based comics anthology “Raw.” Nicole Rudick’s excellent afterword situates Panter as a visionary amid a flood of movements, influences, declarations (his own “Rozz-Tox Manifesto,” originally published as want ads, looked for inspiration in smashed-up capitalism) and artistic fellow travelers. (Among the latter was Matt Groening: Jimbo’s close-cropped hairdo would later inspire Bart Simpson’s.)
