Is There Really Such a Thing as Maternal Instinct?
MOM GENESInside the New Science of Our Ancient Maternal InstinctBy Abigail TuckerAs a journalist and young mother, Abigail Tucker wanted scientific proof that the female of our species possesses a maternal instinct. Yet after she spoke with dozens of scientists around the world, the hope of a clear biochemical explanation for mothering crumbled like graham crackers in Tucker’s hands. The researchers admitted that “variation in a woman’s genes can — albeit to a very, very slight degree — help explain her real-world behavior toward her child,” and that to study maternal genetics is to be “at the base of this humongous mountain” they “are not sure how to climb,” one researcher admitted. Not exactly the groundbreaking insight you’d expect from a book titled “Mom Genes: Inside the New Science of Our Ancient Maternal Instinct.” Yet arguably, the book reveals something more valuable.But first the science. While taking the reader on a traipse through various laboratories, Tucker tosses off quips like a class clown on a science field trip. She’s cutesy about her subject: “I thought that unlocking the secrets of the maternal brain would mean looking for something discrete and self-contained, and maybe even helpfully labeled, like the ladies’ lounge in a department store.” Of the brain, she opines it’s “something of a jumble in there, like the contents of a mother’s handbag.”
