Girl Reporter Exposes Town’s Dirty (Water) Secret
THE LEAKWritten by Kate Reed PettyIllustrated by Andrea BellAs a nosy kid in Wisconsin with endless unstructured outdoor time, I occupied myself with the comings and goings of my neighbors. A self-styled Harriet the Spy, I carried a notebook, filed dispatches for my homemade newspaper and proudly mailed copies of it — The Bosman Bulletin, written in navy ballpoint on loose-leaf paper — to my older sister at sleepaway camp.Kids have seriously evolved since then. In the graphic novel “The Leak,” by Kate Reed Petty and Andrea Bell, Ruth Keller, a 12-year-old news junkie, takes tween-journalist ambition to a new level, seeing misdeeds and corruption around every corner in her town of Twin Oaks. During a fishing excursion with a boy from school, she discovers suspicious black slime in the lake by a country club, and a dead fish that might have succumbed to whatever was in it, setting her on the trail of local businesses dumping polluted water in drains.Ruth is armed with tools that would have put my circa-1991 self to shame: a cellphone for snapping surreptitious photos, a computer for research, lab equipment for running tests and a weekly e-newsletter with a subscriber base that skyrockets after each investigation.“The Leak” is a spirited story of civic responsibility, of how to tell fake news from the real thing, of when to trust adults and when to publicly stick it to them. Dedicated to the people of Flint, Mich., it might not have been conceived if it hadn’t been for that city’s water crisis, a cautionary tale of the perils of trusting government to keep citizens safe from harm.
