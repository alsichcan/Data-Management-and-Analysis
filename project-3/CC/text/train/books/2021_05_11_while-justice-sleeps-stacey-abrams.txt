Stacey Abrams’s Legal Thriller Has Many Moving Pieces
WHILE JUSTICE SLEEPSBy Stacey AbramsOne approaches a legal thriller rooted in high-stakes Washington politics with a certain trepidation — and a curiosity deepened, in this case, by Stacey Abrams’s chosen setting: the U.S. Supreme Court.Questions proliferate. Will there be actual Republicans and Democrats? Will the politics feel authentic — as they did, for example, in Allen Drury’s Pulitzer Prize-winning epic from the 1950s, “Advise and Consent”?Will the justices — as in life — be divided by ideology as well as by their disparate and often quirky personas? Will the author truly try to represent the hermetic world of the court or, hardest of all, the secretive and often byzantine process through which it renders its decisions?Much depends on her intentions. Does she pitch the book to the small and picky audience that truly knows the world she purports to portray, while trying to bring the less sophisticated along for the ride? Or, seeking to engage a mass audience more interested in entertainment than authenticity, will she use the high-concept setting for a purpose both less and more ambitious: selling books?
