When Teacups, Burning Lumps of Coal and Eggs Flew Through the Air
THE HAUNTING OF ALMA FIELDINGA True Ghost StoryBy Kate SummerscaleThere goes an egg, sailing across the living room to smash into a sideboard. And here comes a big chunk of coal, hot from the fireplace, headed straight for somebody’s skull. What do you think — time to call Ghostbusters?The chief spook hunter in Kate Summerscale’s delightful period piece, “The Haunting of Alma Fielding,” is Nandor Fodor, a Hungarian-born investigator at the International Institute for Psychical Research in London. Fodor had first become interested in the paranormal while working as a journalist in New York City. But it wasn’t until he moved back to England that he immersed himself in the spiritualist movement, joining the Ghost Club, the London Spiritualist Alliance and other organizations of true believers, writing for their publications and attending séances. “A séance room was a permissive place,” according to Summerscale, “mystical, tactile, erotically charged.”Fodor was keen to catch the poltergeist that was creating havoc at Alma Fielding’s home, but he wasn’t exactly bringing an open mind to the investigation. In fact, he was hoping to find proof of his theory that “repressed traumatic experiences could generate terrifying physical events.” But if Alma’s mischievous poltergeist was the invention of her own agitated psyche, then what memory was she suppressing?
