In ‘Philip Roth,’ a Life of the Literary Master as Aggrieved Playboy
In 2013, Philip Roth was around 80, recently retired and finally at peace — or so he was fond of saying.As a young novelist, he used to goad himself in the mirror: “Attack! Attack!” Later, his credo would become “Let the repellent in.” Over the course of his career — 31 books in 51 years, from the deviltry of his madmen Alexander Portnoy and Mickey Sabbath to the suffering of the tragic heroes in his so-called American trilogy (“American Pastoral,” “I Married a Communist” and “The Human Stain”) — he tilted against the seductions of group identity. Whether he was pilloried as the Jewish second coming of Goebbels (“What is being done to silence this man?” the president of the Rabbinical Council of America wrote to the Anti-Defamation League) or a woman hater, he held to the notion of novelist as the “nose in the seam of the undergarment,” the enemy of public relations. And now, he who found liberation in sex and work reported being rid of the tyranny of both.“Virtually every night I go to sleep with a goofy smile on my face,” he wrote to a friend, “and in the dark am made positively gleeful by softly uttering aloud, ‘I have recovered my life before I was embattled. The battles are over. I’ve come home. And I won.’”On the whole, winners do not, I think, behave as Roth did in those years, frenziedly shoring up the legacy and burnishing the brand. He put together a page-by-page rebuttal of his ex-wife Claire Bloom’s scathing memoir of their marriage, which friends persuaded him not to publish. He dumped one biographer (his erstwhile best friend Ross Miller) and hired another (Blake Bailey), while, in effect, trying to ghostwrite the thing himself, conscripting friends to conduct interviews with the questions he provided.
