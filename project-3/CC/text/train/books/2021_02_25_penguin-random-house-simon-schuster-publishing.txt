What Happens When a Publisher Becomes a Megapublisher?
When Penguin Random House said last year that it planned to buy Simon & Schuster for more than $2 billion, the entire publishing industry snapped to attention.The merger of two of the largest publishers in the United States — Penguin Random House is already the biggest by almost any metric — has the potential to touch every piece of the book business, including how much writers get paid, which books get priority at printing plants and how independent bookshops are run. All this comes amid an atmosphere of increased attention on the dominance of large companies like Facebook and Google, and a new Justice Department to evaluate them.“We don’t know what the Biden administration’s antitrust approach will look like,” said Erik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan Ross School of Business. “But this one will get careful scrutiny.”One of the main questions federal regulators will look at when deciding whether to approve the deal, Mr. Gordon said, is how big the two companies would be if combined. Publishing is a fragmented business: There are general interest publishers and academic publishers, big companies and small ones, as well as people who self-publish. All that makes it difficult to get an accurate read on how dominant any one player is.
