Books About Racism and Police Violence Fill Out List of ‘Most Challenged’ Titles
When the American Library Association released its list of the 10 most frequently banned or challenged books of 2020, it was no surprise to Angie Thomas that her debut novel, “The Hate U Give,” had made its return to the list for a third appearance.“The book has basically been on that list since it came out,” Thomas said on Wednesday. “I joke to people and say all the time, There are two lists you can usually find ‘The Hate U Give’ on: The New York Times and the most banned book list.”The novel, about a 16-year-old Black girl who witnesses a police officer shoot and kill her childhood friend, grapples with timely subjects like police violence and race relations and is the subject of constant challenges. According to the library association, challenges to the book have cited its drug references, profanity and “an anti-police message.”
