Lengthy Biographies, James Joyce and Other Letters to the Editor
To the Editor:Daphne Merkin is to be lauded for her review of “Red Comet” (Dec. 27), Heather Clark’s new work about the “Short Life and Blazing Art of Sylvia Plath.” The combination of extraordinary talent and self-destructive behavior culminating in suicide sparks the curiosity of many of us, especially those, like myself, who have spent decades working in the world of mental health. Merkin herself is someone who has suffered her own depression and has shared this with us in many illuminating and provocative works.Merkin wonders whether “there is little to be added” about Plath, but then dispels this not only with her discussion of Clark’s ideas but also by providing those of her own.Especially poignant was Clark’s observation, emphasized by Merkin, that Plath’s last poems were filled with a mixture of both rage and control. Clark gives voice to their intriguing impression of “having been written posthumously,” the paradoxical but also very real sense of the admixture of life and death in suicide.While Merkin does not lead us to the solution of the mystery of suicide, she whets our appetite to hear not only more about Plath but also more of her own speculations and insights.
