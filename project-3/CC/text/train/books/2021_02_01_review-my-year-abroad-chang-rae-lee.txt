Chang-rae Lee’s Latest Is Fueled by Harrowing Travel, Witness Protection and Food, Food and More Food
Chang-rae Lee’s new novel, “My Year Abroad,” is, like everything he writes, considered and elegant, formal and philosophical. He’s firmly in command. He remains in command while this novel runs straight off the road and into a deep ravine. To borrow a euphemism from the world of aeronautics, this long and draggy book is a “controlled flight into terrain.”The novel’s protagonist is Tiller, a 20-year-old college student from New Jersey. When we first meet him, he’s been through an unspecified harrowing experience. He’s in the Hong Kong airport with just his clothes, a small folding knife, an A.T.M. card and some lingering bruises, as if God has flung him from a bough.In the food court he meets Val, a single mother in her 30s. She’s from New Jersey, too. They hit it off. Both are only children (this novel is swimming with these, and with orphans) and both are one-eighth Asian. Tiller likes to refer to himself as “a semi-diasporic postcolonial indeterminate.”They return to New Jersey and move in together. Val has had harrowing experiences of her own. She’s in a witness protection program after ratting out her husband, who seems to have fallen out of a minor episode of “The Sopranos”: He was tangled up in rocket launchers, fake caviar and Mongolian mineral rights, and he possibly abetted terrorists.
