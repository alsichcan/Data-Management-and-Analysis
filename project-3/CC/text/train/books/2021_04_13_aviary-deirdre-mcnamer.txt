The Secret of Ongoingness, in a Novel About a Retirement Home
AVIARY By Deirdre McNamerIn Deirdre McNamer’s new novel, “Aviary,” we learn right away that things are off. It hasn’t been a normal autumn, as evidenced by the leaves on the trees refusing to drop. “They have clung, ash-colored, to the branches, inspiring general unease and several letters to the newspaper, which invited a certified arborist to weigh in,” McNamer writes. Because of extreme cold at the wrong time, the process of separation between leaf and twig has been interrupted, the arborist explains, but there’s still the fact that the whole thing just feels wrong.Also unsettling is what’s going on at Pheasant Run, the 24-unit retirement home where McNamer sets much of her action. First, there’s the dreadful on-site manager, Herbie Bonebright, who has been installed by the facility’s new, cheaper property management company. Bonebright has a penchant for wearing Hawaiian shirts and flip-flops with Bermuda shorts, but he’s not just a sartorial menace. He threatens the tenants he’s there to assist, sets accidental fires and isn’t even a decent handyman.
