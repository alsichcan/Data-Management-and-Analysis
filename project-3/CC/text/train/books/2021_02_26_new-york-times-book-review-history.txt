Reviewing the Book Review
Halfway through “Lolita,” Humbert Humbert — relaxed, triumphant and a mere pinch of pages away from his downfall — stops to extol the wonders of America. He has dragged his 12-year-old quarry on a road trip across the country, a perversion of a honeymoon. He slips into French to marvel at all they have seen. “Nous connûmes,” he purrs, borrowing “a Flaubertian intonation” — we came to know — and enumerates each guesthouse and motel, each unsmiling landlady. Nous connûmes — we came to know. It has felt like the mood of the moment, with the reappraisal of monuments, real and metaphorical, in our midst — writers included. There have been fresh considerations of Faulkner, Flannery O’Connor, David Foster Wallace and others, as their private papers and private lives have come to light. Nous connûmes Nabokov himself; this past year brought forth a swarm of studies and, in March, an anthology dedicated to “Lolita” alone. The morality of the novel, and of its creator, are litigated with hot urgency, as if Nabokov, dead some 40 years, lingers in the dock somewhere.Not a surprising moment, then, to be asked to explore the archives of The New York Times Book Review on the occasion of its 125th anniversary, a moment for celebration but also for some more challenging introspection, a moment to examine the publication’s legacy in full. My brief, you could say, was to review the Book Review, to consider the coverage of “women, people of color, L.G.B.T.Q. writers” and changing mores in criticism. But what revelatory news could I possibly bring? The word “archive” derives from the ancient Greek arkheion, sometimes translated as “house of the ruler.” Who wanders there with any illusions?What could those reviews contain? Some misjudgments, to be sure — masterpieces misunderstood in their time. A few preternaturally sensitive assessments. Fluorescent condescension and stereotype. Above all, the pleasant and dubious satisfactions of feeling superior to the past.
