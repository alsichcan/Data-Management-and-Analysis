How to Pay for College (and Not Lose Your Shirt)
THE PRICE YOU PAY FOR COLLEGEAn Entirely New Road Map for the Biggest Financial Decision Your Family Will Ever MakeBy Ron LieberEvery self-help book begins with a view of the problem that it aims to help readers solve. Ron Lieber’s masterly “The Price You Pay for College” announces that problem in its subtitle: “the biggest financial decision your family will ever make.” The book promises to help readers apply to, choose, bargain with and pay for a college — to navigate the enormously expensive, intricate and pressure-filled system that is higher education in the United States today.Understood as a self-help book, “The Price You Pay for College” represents an extraordinary achievement: It is comprehensive and detailed without being tedious, practical without being banal, impeccably well judged and unusually rigorous. But the main title hints at a sensibility deeper than friendly advice. The terrain the book charts is too treacherous to traverse unscathed, exacting a toll from all who pass through it. Fidelity to genre prevents Lieber from developing this sensibility into a critique that explains what has gone wrong and argues for a better way. To learn to navigate a system is not yet to grasp its causes and consequences, or to know how to change it.
