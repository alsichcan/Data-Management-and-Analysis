Peter Manso, Biographer of Brando and Mailer, Dies at 80
Peter Manso, an embracing biographer of Marlon Brando and Norman Mailer and a journalist whose piercing interviews with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Edward I. Koch returned to haunt them when they ran for the governorships of California and New York, respectively, died on Wednesday at his home in Truro, Mass., on Cape Cod. He was 80.The cause was heart failure, his wife, Anna Avellar, said.A New York native who fancied racing and writing about fast cars, Mr. Manso preferred an unhurried, painstaking, scholarly approach to researching what proved to be mammoth oral biographies, consisting heavily of transcribed interviews. The 768-page “Mailer: His Life and Times” (1985) took him six years to write. He worked for eight years on his definitively titled “Brando: The Biography” (1994), which weighed in at 1,160 pages.In The New York Times Book Review, Barbara Goldsmith called Mr. Manso’s book on Mr. Mailer “the quintessential celebrity biography.” Christopher Lehmann-Haupt wrote in The Times that the size of the book “seems just plain ridiculous,” but “try dipping into Mr. Manso’s interviews without at once becoming addicted.”Mr. Manso wrote prolifically for magazines (many of his articles were translated into French and published in the newspaper Paris Match as well) and was the author of several other books, including “Ptown: Art, Sex and Money on the Outer Cape” (2003), and “Reasonable Doubt: The Fashion Writer, Cape Cod, and the Trial of Chris McCowen” (2011), in which he challenged the conviction of a 34-year-old garbage collector with a low I.Q. in the 2002 stabbing death of Mr. Manso’s neighbor Christa Worthington, a 46-year-old fashion writer and single mother from an old Cape Cod family.
