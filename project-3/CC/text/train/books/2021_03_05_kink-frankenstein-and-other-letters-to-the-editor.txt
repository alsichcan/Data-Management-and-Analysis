Kink, Frankenstein and Other Letters to the Editor
To the Editor:The sentence from the introduction of “Kink” quoted in Jazmine Hughes’s review (Feb. 14) is the stuff of high parody. To wit, R. O. Kwon and Garth Greenwell’s anthology of stories serves to “recognize how the questions raised in intimate, kinky encounters — questions of power, agency, identity — can help us to interrogate and begin to rescript the larger cultural narratives that surround us,” each word from the playbook of academic respectability.How “transgressive” is B.D.S.M. (an abbreviation which apparently needs no introduction to Times readers) when it comes from a major publisher, and presents itself in the anodyne jargon of academe? In other words, how pervy is kink anyway?Molly Haskell New YorkTo the Editor:In reviewing Ayaan Hirsi Ali’s “Prey” (Feb. 14), Jill Filipovic is rightly wary of condemning an entire religion. However, Hirsi Ali’s memoir, “Infidel,” convinced me that the abuses and problems she discussed there are very real in parts of Africa, and doubtless in other heavily patriarchal societies. Filipovic fills space by criticizing Hirsi Ali personally and nit-picking her feminist credentials, but omits the crucial statistics Hirsi Ali provides in “Prey.” Did Filipovic fear the statistics might be too convincing?According to a 2016 New Yorker article, some half a million women in the United States have been genitally mutilated or are at risk. Is this really just fine? A culture is a value system. Why should we think people will automatically give up theirs when they come here? And in fact, we currently encourage newcomers to keep their original culture: the salad bowl, not the melting pot.
