A Novel of Sex, Faith and Lots of Yogurt
MILK FEDBy Melissa BroderIf there was ever a novel to defy a one-sentence description, Melissa Broder’s new novel would be it. An exploration of hunger centered on a young woman with an eating disorder who finds salvation in the arms of an Orthodox Jewish frozen yogurt scooper, “Milk Fed” is an even stranger animal than this description might suggest. Estranged from her family, from her body and from the spiritual world, the so-named Rachel obsessively plans and counts her highly restricted caloric intake down to the last muffin top, then forces herself to burn off 3,500 of said calories per week at the gym.In between these triumphs of self-denial, Rachel somnambulistically reports to work at a Hollywood talent management agency, where her fatuous, frat-brother-like boss addresses his clients as “my duuudes” and makes “constant references to his ‘privilege,’ also our privilege to be working there. … Talent management was not my dream, and this hurt him.”With its deadpan tone and self-loathing female narrator attempting to escape her self, the novel may call to mind Ottessa Moshfegh’s “My Year of Rest and Relaxation.” But where Moshfegh’s protagonist lives to sleep, Broder’s antiheroine lives to eat. Sweet, rich and fattening foods, from duck sauce to doughnuts, are Rachel’s forbidden fruit.[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of February. See the full list. ]The turning point comes when Rachel’s therapist encourages her to cut off contact with her fat-shaming mother and use modeling clay to “identify, in a visual, tactile way, the discrepancy between how you perceive yourself and how you actually appear to others.” The likeness Rachel sculpts is full-figured; she feels tricked and storms out, albeit absconding with the clay figure, which she comes to regard as her personal golem.
