National Book Foundation Names New Leader
The National Book Foundation said on Thursday that Ruth Dickey, the executive director of the literary nonprofit Seattle Arts & Lectures, will become the organization’s new executive director.An award-winning poet and essayist, Dickey served as a fiction judge for the National Book Awards in 2019. For the past 25 years, she has worked at arts organizations and nonprofits across the United States, a background that she could draw on to help the foundation expand.Before she led Seattle Arts & Lectures, Dickey, 49, worked as the executive director of the Clifton Cultural Arts Center in Cincinnati, where she helped transform a vacant school into a regional organization, and as the executive director of New Futures in Burien, Wash., a group that worked with families in low-income housing.“Ruth is not just a literary leader but is someone with a track record in social justice and a national scope,” said David Steinberger, the chair of the National Book Foundation’s board of directors. “You see through her work a real commitment to expanding the audience for books, with a special effort for people who are disadvantaged, who are poor, who are homeless.”
