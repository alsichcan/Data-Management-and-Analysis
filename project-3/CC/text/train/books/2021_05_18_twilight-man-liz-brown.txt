A Hollywood Love Story With Glitz, Greed and the Threat of Social Ruin
TWILIGHT MANLove and Ruin in the Shadows of Hollywood and the Clark EmpireBy Liz BrownAh, family secrets. My specialty.I’m not going to divulge (all of) mine, at least not here, but I will say this much: I grew up in Montana at a time when it was most definitely not OK to be gay, much less have a gay father. I know how secrets can corrode your insides, resulting in a toxic, bubbling shame. And I know how healing it can be to expose secrets to daylight. The opposite of what you worry is going to happen happens. The people you care about run toward your vulnerability and respond with theirs.These truths course through “Twilight Man: Love and Ruin in the Shadows of Hollywood and the Clark Empire,” Liz Brown’s painstaking debut. She set out to learn more about a mysterious photograph, one that her grandmother had tucked away in a bedroom drawer. The bonkers saga she uncovered involves Prohibition-era Hollywood, the Copper Kings of Montana, a treacherous sister, a Nazi prison, a crook named Charles Crooks, Mexico City nightclubs and a gallant whippet named Gynt. At its center is a gay love story that, as Brown writes in the introduction, had been “wrongfully erased.”
