John Naisbitt, Business Guru and Author of ‘Megatrends,’ Dies at 92
John Naisbitt, a struggling business consultant and trend watcher who in 1982 hit it big with “Megatrends,” a book that galvanized a country just emerging from a gut-wrenching recession with its prediction of a bountiful high-tech economy right around the corner, died on Thursday at his home in Velden am Wörthersee, Austria. He was 92.His daughter Claire Schwadron confirmed the death.Predicting the future was big business back in the 1980s, and bookshelves were crowded with writers claiming to see what was in store for a country still reeling from the tumult of the 1960s and ’70s. Mr. Naisbitt outdid them all: “Megatrends: Ten New Directions Transforming Our Lives” sat on the New York Times best-seller list for two years, mostly in the No. 1 spot, selling 14 million copies in 57 countries.Other writers, like Peter F. Drucker, were more cerebral, or, like Alvin Toffler, more guarded about the future’s promise. Not Mr. Naisbitt. Like Ronald Reagan, who came into office the year before “Megatrends” appeared, he cheerfully claimed to see an edenic postindustrial economy emerging from the ashes of its blue-collar predecessor.While Mr. Naisbitt was born in 1929, and so preceded the baby boom by nearly a generation, he believed that it was the values of the 1960s counterculture — individualism, spiritualism, feminism — that would drive the country toward this new era of economic and cultural bounty.
