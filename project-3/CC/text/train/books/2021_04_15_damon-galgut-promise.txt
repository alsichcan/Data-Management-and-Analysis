A Family, and a Nation Under Apartheid, Tears at the Seams
THE PROMISEBy Damon GalgutFor three decades the South African writer Damon Galgut has been assessing his country through scrutiny of its white people. His prior novels include the Booker Prize finalist “The Good Doctor,” set at a clinic in one of apartheid’s forlorn “homelands,” and “The Impostor,” an account of a poet self-exiled to the lonely countryside. Galgut’s new work, “The Promise,” studies the Swart family, descendants of Voortrekker settlers, clinging to their farm amid tumultuous social and political change — “just an ordinary bunch of white South Africans,” he writes, “holding on, holding out.” Beginning in 1986, the novel moves toward the present, following Ma, Pa and the alliterative trio of Swart children: Anton, a military deserter and failed novelist; Astrid, a narcissistic housewife; and Amor, an introspective loner who eventually becomes a nurse.“The Promise” adopts a protean tone, now menacing, now darkly mirthful. By its close, only one Swart will remain alive, and Galgut keeps a bead on mortality and the body; the chores of funeral directors are laid out in highly unsentimental detail, as are the bad smells of the living and the dead. Repeatedly Galgut invokes the motif of something bitter or rank buried at the “sour core” within both the Swarts and their country, and perhaps within existence itself: “a lie at the heart of everything,” “the stink of sacrifice at the center of the world.”Starting with the accession of Nelson Mandela, the novel registers seismic rumbles of a changing South Africa. Yet white characters remain casually dismissive of Black people and their “unknowable lives”; everyone, Astrid muses, “just went on like before, except it was nicer because there was forgiveness and no more boycotts.” From the Swarts’ complacency emerges one thread of redemption, tied to a long-deferred promise — that the family’s servant, Salome, might inherit the modest house on the property that she lives in. Galgut deploys the unkept vow as a stand-in for white South Africa’s moral bankruptcy.
