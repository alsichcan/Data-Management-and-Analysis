Mingling Fact and Fiction, Jo Ann Beard Bares Her Subjects’ Souls
FESTIVAL DAYSBy Jo Ann BeardThere’s a pencil with bite marks I can’t get out of my mind. It appears in one of the pieces in Jo Ann Beard’s ferocious new collection, “Festival Days.” A doctor uses the pencil to point out spots of cancer on an X-ray. It’s the kind of detail — mundane, yet giving off a whiff of tension — that lodges. It makes the scene feel authentic and the writer feel trustworthy. We can rely on her to miss nothing. She will gather the essential elements and arrange them before us with such precision that, without instructing us how to see, she grants us sight.But what, exactly, are we seeing? This question nipped at my heels throughout this book, even as the writing propelled me forward. That pencil with the bite marks is from a piece called “Cheri,” which illuminates the perspective of a terminally ill woman. We accompany Cheri through 45 pages of diagnoses and treatments, also through yardwork and a new puppy and cups of milky tea, all the while looping in and out of her childhood memories, rife with details so specific and intimate that in the end, when she is beyond speech, it feels somehow natural that we are privy to her thoughts.
