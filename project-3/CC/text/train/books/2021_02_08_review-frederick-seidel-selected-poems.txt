This Dark Prince of American Poetry Writes With Glittering Malice
The way to read Frederick Seidel’s “Selected Poems” is to remove the dust jacket, light a match and torch it. It’s not that the jacket is unattractive. But the hard cover underneath it is ink black. Once the jacket’s gone, you have what each of Seidel’s volumes aspire to be: a little black book.You may also want to flip it over and read it back to front. Seidel is among the rare poets who’ve become noticeably better — nervier, more tricksy and electric — as they’ve slid into old age.Seidel, who turns 85 next week, knows this. His “Collected Poems,” published a decade or so ago, were arranged in reverse chronological order. Like Harold Pinter’s “Betrayal,” Martin Amis’s “Time’s Arrow” and Stephen Sondheim’s “Merrily We Roll Along,” it traveled backward in time, movingly, from experience to innocence.The word “innocence” is not easily applied to Seidel’s work. His poetic credo, articulated in a Paris Review interview, is: “Write beautifully what people don’t want to hear.” He’s the Dark Prince of American poetry, a writer of glittering malice, one who cuts against the grain of almost every variety of community feeling. He’s not a poet for everyone, but no poet worth anything is.
