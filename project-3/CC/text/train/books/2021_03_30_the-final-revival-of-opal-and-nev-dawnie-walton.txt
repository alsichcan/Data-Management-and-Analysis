A Musician’s Daughter Faces His Music — and His Choices
THE FINAL REVIVAL OF OPAL & NEVBy Dawnie WaltonThis novel is so good, I want to rent a velvet-swagged amphitheater and gather a large audience to blare through a microphone just how much I like it. But given present circumstances, these subdued little pixels will have to do.It’s above all a reminder of such places that used to clump humanity together in sweaty artistic and intellectual communion, not only before the pandemic — festivals, parties, concerts — but before the iPhonedemic. Libraries, record stores, closed-door offices. Events recorded in photographs taken using cameras loaded with film, wondering how the reel would come out.Ingeniously structured as an oral history stretching from the dawn of the civil rights movement to the Trump-torn 2010s, “The Final Revival of Opal & Nev” is like a rockumentary in written form, with bonus commentary. Its D. A. Pennebaker is one S. Sunny Shelton, née SarahLena after Vaughan and Horne: a name obscured self-protectively after the murder of her father, a drummer, during a 1971 musical showcase that after devolving into a race riot is dubbed “Altamont East” by the media.
