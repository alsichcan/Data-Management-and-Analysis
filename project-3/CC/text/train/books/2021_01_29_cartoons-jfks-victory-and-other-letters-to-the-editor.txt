Cartoons, JFK’s Victory and Other Letters to the Editor
To the Editor:I am everything but a Black, queer, nonbinary American. Born and educated in England, I am a white, straight, unequivocally female naturalized citizen. Danez Smith’s review of Robert Jones Jr.’s novel, “The Prophets” (Jan. 17), opened my eyes to a perspective I had never thought about and surprised my heart wide open with its lyrical charge and fierce passion.Smith’s hopes, fears, history and honesty are unique to their experience but universal in their ability to move another human heart.Gillian Renault Atlanta♦To the Editor:Simone Martin-Newberry’s illustration of Isaiah and Samuel, the central characters of “The Prophets,” piqued my curiosity. Two slave boys embrace, as seven hands touch their lithe bodies.Interestingly, 13 celestial stars adorn the two bare-chested Black partners, who are bathed in royal purple. Is this a sign of protection from the gods, or will the twosome be put to death for expressing forbidden love?
