A Novel of Infidelity and the Art World, on a Crowded Canvas
THE ART OF FALLINGBy Danielle McLaughlinDanielle McLaughlin is a remarkable writer. Reading “Dinosaurs on Other Planets,” her 2016 collection of short stories, one is struck by the sheer gorgeousness of the prose, particularly in descriptions of natural settings; by the quick, seemingly effortless characterizations of her often very complex characters; by the elegant and sometimes devastating economy of the narration; and by McLaughlin’s sure-handed sense of the shape of the short story. It’s exciting to read the work of someone who is so clearly gifted.In her new novel, her first, “The Art of Falling,” we encounter many of these same gifts, but here they’re not offered with as sure a hand. And when they do make themselves evident, they often seem swamped by a tendency to pile on event after event, as if that were the difference between a short story and a novel — the need for more to happen, and even more after that.The plot, then. Our main character, Nessa, is struggling to come to terms with her husband Philip’s infidelity with the mother of their daughter’s best friend; and simultaneously trying to cope with this newly hostile daughter. In addition, she’s mounting a gallery show of the work of one Robert Locke, a long-dead sculptor, hoping to bring new attention to what she sees as his strange genius, embodied most perfectly in the faceless statue of a pregnant woman. She’s been working closely with his difficult elderly widow and devoted daughter, who hope, for several reasons — money for them, renewed fame and glory for him — for the show’s success.Complicating this is the persistent claim made by another, less elderly woman (though her age seems variable) that she, and not Locke, was either the creator of his most famous work; or perhaps only helped to create it; or inspired it; or maybe was the model for it. Tiresomely, she keeps popping up to press one or another of these claims: at a talk Nessa gives at the gallery, at Nessa’s home, then at the home of Locke’s widow, and again at the gallery, this time pretending to be a docent, and so on. All of which threatens the integrity of the upcoming show.
