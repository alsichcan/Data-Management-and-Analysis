Robert Hershon, Artful Poet Who Published Poets, Dies at 84
Robert Hershon, a writer of sly, perceptive poetry who as a founder of Hanging Loose Press also furthered the careers of countless other poets, died on March 20 at a hospital in Brooklyn. He was 84.His daughter, Elizabeth Hershon, said the cause was complications of pneumonia.Mr. Hershon published more than a dozen collections of his own poems, works that could be amusing, touching or both. That description fits one of his best-known poems, “Sentimental Moment or Why Did the Baguette Cross the Road?”:Don’t fill up on breadI say absent-mindedlyThe servings here are hugeMy son, whose hair may bereceding a bit, saysDid you really justsay that to me?What he doesn’t knowis that when we’re walkingtogether, when we getto the curbI sometimes start to reachfor his handMr. Hershon was a godfather of sorts to many younger poets. In 1966 he joined Dick Lourie, Ron Schreiber and Emmett Jarrett in founding Hanging Loose Press, which at first was a poetry journal of loose mimeographed pages (thus the name) sold in a printed envelope that did double duty as a cover.
