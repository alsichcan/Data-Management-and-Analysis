They Hooked Up at Her Bachelorette Party. Now He’s Stalking Her.
Let Carole Johnstone take you on a tour of MIRRORLAND (Scribner, 306 pp., $27), the elaborate imaginary world invented by El and Cat, a pair of twins, during their gruesome childhood in Edinburgh. Like a fun house hall of mirrors, this alternate reality is terrifying as well as diverting.Years have passed. Now El is missing, presumed dead — and Cat has reluctantly returned home from a long exile to help find her twin. Someone (could it be El?) is leaving mysterious clues for her. But can we trust her unreliable narration? “No one has ever lied or hidden the truth from me better than I have,” she admits.In this unsettling, labyrinthine tale, it is hard at first to tell who the villain is — or even how many villains there are in a family with a great deal to hide. The book unlocks its mysteries slowly, twisting the knife a little deeper with each revelation.One person can help Cat wade through the morass: familiar, sexy Ross, who loved both sisters (or so he says), dated Cat and then broke her heart by marrying El. Should Cat take him at his word when he declares that she is the one he wanted all along? Or should she believe what El told her friends, that Ross had turned dark, abusive and dangerous? “Mirrorland” will unsettle you as you accept, and then discard, every instinct you have about each of its characters.
