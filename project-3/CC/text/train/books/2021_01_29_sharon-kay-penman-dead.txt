Sharon Kay Penman, Whose Novels Plumbed Britain’s Past, Dies at 75
Sharon Kay Penman, a former tax lawyer whose best-selling epics about medieval England and Wales drew legions of admirers for her meticulous research and commitment to historical facts, died on Jan. 22 in a hospital in Atlantic City, N.J. She was 75.Her brother, William J. Penman Jr., said the cause was pneumonia.“She was a giant in the field,” said Margaret George, the author of historical novels like “The Splendor Before the Dark,” about the Roman emperor Nero. “She was a diligent scholar, but she was able to write accessible books that were real page-turners.”Starting with her first book, “The Sunne in Splendour” (1982), about King Richard III, Ms. Penman loaded her novels with material she gathered from years of research, both on the ground in Britain and in the stacks at the University of Pennsylvania library, near her home. Before the internet made finding obscure history books easy, she would scour secondhand shops in England, shipping home boxes and boxes of texts, amassing a library of several thousand volumes.
