‘The Free World’ Explains How Culture Heated Up During the Cold War
In the spring of 1999, Louis Menand taught a class called “Art and Thought of the 1960s” at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. He assigned Malcolm X, Joan Didion, “Portnoy’s Complaint.” Toward the end of the semester, he told his students he was thinking of writing a book about the ’60s. Maybe he shouldn’t, they told him.“So you can make a painting of a soup can — that’s not such a big deal,” Menand said, characterizing his students’ response. Sixties culture, he recognized, was a close ancestor of the culture of the day. “I realized,” he added, “that what they were really interested in was the ’50s, which they didn’t understand as well.”Menand took his students’ note. The result, “The Free World: Art and Thought in the Cold War,” will be published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux on Tuesday. The book seeks to explain not the ’60s scene (though Andy Warhol, soup cans and all, does appear), but how the ground was prepared for it by the West’s most influential thinkers, authors and artists between 1945 and 1965.“This book is the back story to contemporary American culture,” said Menand, 69, in a video interview earlier this month from Cambridge, Mass., where he is a professor at Harvard. “It’s about the emergence of an American culture that became central in world affairs.”
