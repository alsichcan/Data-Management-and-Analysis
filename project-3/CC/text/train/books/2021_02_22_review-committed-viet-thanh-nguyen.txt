Viet Thanh Nguyen Packs Plenty of Action and Outrage Into ‘The Committed’
If I’m a boat person, thinks the narrator of Viet Thanh Nguyen’s “The Committed,” so were the English Pilgrims who came to America on the Mayflower.The Pilgrims were lucky in their public relations, he continues. There were no video cameras to capture them, thin, dazed and lice-ridden, stumbling in the surf. Instead, romantic painters glorified them in oils.“The Committed” is a sequel to Nguyen’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel “The Sympathizer” (2015). The books share a narrator, a Communist spy, half-Vietnamese and half-French, who refers to himself as “a man of two faces and two minds.”This new novel is set in the early 1980s, as the man of two faces flees not to America but to France. He’s survived a harrowing boat trip, and a flight from Jakarta with Bon, his “best friend and blood brother.” Their story is complicated to unwind.
