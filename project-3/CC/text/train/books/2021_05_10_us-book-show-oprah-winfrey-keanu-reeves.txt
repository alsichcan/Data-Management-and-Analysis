Oprah Winfrey, Keanu Reeves to Participate in New Book Show
Publishers Weekly will host a new trade fair for the book business this month called the U.S. Book Show, stepping in to replace some of what disappeared when BookExpo, a convention that filled the Javits Center in New York every May, was retired last year.The Book Show, which will be held virtually May 25-27, is aimed at librarians, independent booksellers and book buyers from major chain stores. It is intended to help publishers push their biggest fall titles, which is when many of the biggest books of the year are released in advance of the crucial holiday shopping season.Two of the main features of the Book Show will be Editor’s Picks panels, during which book editors will discuss some of the most anticipated titles of the fall. There will also be 140 exhibition booths, with book galleys and chapters available to read and private author chats via video and instant messaging. There will also be panels on issues like the future of libraries and of the publishing office.There will be famous speakers, as well. Oprah Winfrey will discuss her book published by Flatiron last month, “What Happened to You?: Conversations on Trauma, Resilience, and Healing.” The actor Keanu Reeves, who created and co-wrote a graphic novel called “BRZRKR,” will be on a panel with his co-author and illustrator. Senator Elizabeth Warren and the authors Anthony Doerr (“All the Light We Cannot See”) and Ijeoma Oluo (“So You Want to Talk About Race”) will speak as well.
