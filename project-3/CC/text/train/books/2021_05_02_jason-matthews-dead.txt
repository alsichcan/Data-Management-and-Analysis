Jason Matthews, C.I.A. Officer Turned Novelist, Dies at 69
Jason Matthews, who after 33 years as a C.I.A. officer in Istanbul, Athens, Belgrade, Rome, Budapest and Hong Kong became a best-selling author of three spy thrillers, died on Wednesday at his home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. He was 69.His wife, Suzanne Matthews, who was also a C.I.A. officer, said the cause was corticobasal degeneration, a rare disease in which nerve cells degenerate and die.In his choice of a second career, Mr. Matthews followed other intelligence officers, like John le Carré, Ian Fleming and Charles McCarry, who became novelists — and who brought to their writing a knowledge of recruiting and handling foreign agents, of dead drops, brush passes, honey traps, debriefings, surveillance and countersurveillance.“A lot of new thrillers are written by people who have not lived the life,” Mr. Matthews told The New York Times in 2015, “and a lot of them seem to be about a bipolar agency guy, helped by his bipolar girlfriend, trying to chase a bipolar terrorist who has a briefcase nuke and there’s 12 hours left to go.”
