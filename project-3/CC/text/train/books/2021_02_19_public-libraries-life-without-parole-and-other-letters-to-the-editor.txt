Public Libraries, Life Without Parole and Other Letters to the Editor
To the Editor:The blurb for Brooke Barker’s terrific Sketchbook of neighborhood “little free libraries” (Jan. 10) says that “you can still borrow books for free even when public libraries are closed.” While the sketch is a wonderful advertisement for little free libraries — which I, as a librarian, fully support — I do want to correct the statement “when public libraries are closed.”Many public libraries did close. However, it was only the buildings that closed; library staff around the world have worked hard to find new ways to provide library materials for their patrons, schools and communities while implementing new health mandates to keep everyone safe.Many libraries have found ingenious ways to keep their communities reading. Our library in Waldport, Ore., used the drive-through window of an old bank building through last spring and summer, where patrons were able to pull up and pick up their items (including summer reading giveaways with books and Take & Make kits). We continue to provide services back at the Waldport Public Library through porch pickup and monthly online programs.Just as we are doing, libraries everywhere are working hard to continue serving communities through online programming, downloadable checkouts and appropriate ways to safely pick up books with little to no contact. So while many of the public library buildings are closed, you can still borrow books from your library.
