Scared Straight or Scarred for Life?
TROUBLEDThe Failed Promise of America’s Behavioral Treatment ProgramsBy Kenneth R. RosenFrom the very start of the prologue of “Troubled” — Kenneth R. Rosen’s examination of the so-called “tough-love industry” of wilderness camps and residential therapeutic programs for young people — there is no mystery about how the author feels about such places. Rosen writes that the parents who choose to send their offspring away “have their children vanished”; that sometimes they do so “through trickery or bribes”; and that these programs, in his view, are “a short-term solution with lasting (mostly negative) effects.”Rosen does not come to this issue primarily as a journalist. He’s a former client, rousted from sleep as a teenager in the middle of the night in 2007 and forced away in what he now calls “a kidnapping.” It would not be his last: Rosen spent time in a secure residential treatment center in Utah, a therapeutic boarding school in Massachusetts and an outdoor therapy program in New York.[ This book was one of our most anticipated titles of the month. See the full list. ]Nothing seemed to take. Juvenile detention followed, and then jail sentences, before he found even footing, starting a family and building a career as a reporter and author. In “Troubled,” Rosen argues that many of his difficulties spring back to that first moment when, as a teenager, his relatively quotidian substance abuse issues might have been addressed by less radical means. “As I was dragged away from my bed and shoved into a van, I felt my future vanish,” he writes. “It took me more than a decade to learn that my initial feelings about these programs were incorrect, that they did lasting damage to me and others like me.”
