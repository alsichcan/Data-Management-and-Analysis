For Him, the Delight Is in the Digging
Patrick Radden Keefe has always been interested in secrets.“I think I have an almost childlike suggestibility where if you tell me you know a secret and you won’t tell, I’m going to do everything I can to figure out what that secret is,” he said in a video interview from his home in Westchester County, N.Y.But if you’ve ever read something Keefe, 44, has written, you may already sense that he has a passion for unearthing what’s hidden. In his 2009 book, “The Snakehead,” he reported on a human smuggling operation run out of New York’s Chinatown, untangling the web of the enterprise and highlighting its victims and its perpetrators. In his 2019 best-seller, “Say Nothing,” he dove into the decades-long sectarian conflict in Northern Ireland, particularly the mystery surrounding Jean McConville, a young mother who was kidnapped from her home in 1972.Now he’s back with a new book, “Empire of Pain,” out from Doubleday on Tuesday, that examines the opioid crisis. It’s a byzantine topic, but Keefe focuses on the Sackler family, which owns Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin.“I didn’t want to write an opioid crisis book per se,” Keefe said. “The hope is that a certain kind of reader will be interested in this book, primarily as a story about a great American dynasty, and what I would argue is the corruption of a great American dynasty.”
