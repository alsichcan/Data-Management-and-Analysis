A Memoir That Sees Only the Tip of the Melting Iceberg
UNSOLACEDAlong the Way to All That IsBy Gretel EhrlichWhen we think of migratory peoples, the images that most likely come to mind are of pastoralists clinging to dwindling herds, their cultures threatened by climate change and the cruel expansion of modern ways. But there exists another class of semi-nomadic people, an exceedingly small one, who are still able to migrate freely as the weather moves them. They pride themselves on their grit and independence and tend not to mention the key resources — money and petroleum — that make their lifestyle possible.Gretel Ehrlich is an exemplary member of this tribe. “Unsolaced,” her latest book, opens “in an off-grid cabin set on a glacial moraine” in the Wind River Mountains of Wyoming. She has another house in Hawaii — “on the Big Island, where I live four months of the year” — and another on 100 acres of untrammeled California coastland. (James Cameron is a neighbor.) “Some internal churning, a chronic restlessness,” she writes, pushes her to travel to the Arctic and to Africa and to wherever fate takes her. A trauma surgeon she meets in an airport tells her about the village in Kosovo where he grew up and his mission “to save the forgotten people of the world.” Ehrlich weeps. “I’ve spent a lot of time living in subsistence villages,” she tells him. “I understand.” Soon she’s on a plane to Pristina.Born into wealth in Santa Barbara — her mother “dabbled in the fashion world” and her father always had a plane — Ehrlich threw off the “bon vivant life” and spent years toiling on cattle ranches, “cowboying” with the last of the breed. “I needed to strip away anything that impeded the feel of the earth,” Ehrlich writes, “anything that obscured direct access” to the raw pulse of terrestrial existence. Her courage is impressive, her experiences no less than extraordinary.
