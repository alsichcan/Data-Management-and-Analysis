Pigeons: Nuisance Animals, or Expert Accomplices in Diamond Smuggling?
FLIGHT OF THE DIAMOND SMUGGLERSA Tale of Pigeons, Obsession, and Greed Along Coastal South AfricaBy Matthew Gavin FrankDiamond mining isn’t the only business built on a lie, though the industry’s central myth — that diamonds are scarce and therefore extremely valuable — has to be among the most brazen.The cartels that mine South Africa, which for generations provided the lion’s share of the world’s diamond supply, perpetuated this inconceivably lucrative fiction by carefully limiting annual production, which is why smuggling was considered such a threat. Black-market diamonds — mostly smuggled out by the impoverished miners themselves — threatened the illusion of scarcity, and so mining concerns long ago became exercises in total control.Until the area began to open up in 2007, a huge portion of South Africa’s west coast was a virtual no-go zone called Die Sperrgebiet (“the Forbidden Zone”) that remained closed to the public for nearly 80 years. Miners lived in company houses, sent their kids to company schools and played cricket on company fields. They never needed to leave and historically were forbidden to do so. At the mines themselves, there are X-ray machines, constant pat-downs and random application of powerful laxatives to discourage those who would swallow contraband. Possession of a diamond in a mining town is cause for arrest, and touching a diamond with your bare skin is not allowed even inside the mines. Miners who die on the job are buried on site, lest their bodies be stuffed with diamonds on the way out. Everything in the mine, the mining town and the mining region is designed to make it as difficult as possible to get the tiny unpolished stones out of the company’s control.
