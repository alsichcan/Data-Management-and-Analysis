The Rise of Elise Stefanik in the Republican Ranks
To the Editor:Re “Elise Stefanik Is Playing a Dangerous Game With Her Career,” by Elizabeth Benjamin (Opinion guest essay, nytimes.com, May 14):By elevating Elise Stefanik to a high post, the Republican Party is trying to move forward by having the party not focus on whether it is pro- or anti-Trump, but rather on what it needs to do to defeat enough Democrats to flip the House and get rid of Nancy Pelosi as speaker.Ms. Stefanik has proved herself to be not only a remarkable fund-raiser for Republican candidates, but also someone who can organize campaigns and get Republicans elected. Although Liz Cheney was a loyal conservative, she kept dwelling on the past and was tearing the party apart — a very counterproductive move. That the Democrats fear a reinvigorated Republican Party is only too evident in the spate of nasty and critical articles that have come out against Ms. Stefanik.I never thought I would hear the liberal media praising the likes of Liz Cheney, the archconservative from Wyoming, but lo and behold, she gets accolades on a regular basis now as they are desperate to denounce the Republican rising star, Elise Stefanik.Mary SykesRye, N.Y.To the Editor:Re “G.O.P. Replaces a Trump Critic With a Trump Convert” (news article, May 15):I am a moderate Republican who has traditionally voted for my party’s line of candidates. I now fear that our party is in trouble. With the removal of Liz Cheney our party has shown that it cares more for the hard right of Republican voters than it does for the truth. This is going to disenfranchise a substantial number of traditional Republican voters like me.
