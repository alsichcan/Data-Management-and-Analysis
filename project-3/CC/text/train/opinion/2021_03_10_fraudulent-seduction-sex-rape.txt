It’s Fraudulent Seduction, but Is It Rape?
To the Editor:Re “You Were Duped Into Saying Yes. Is It Still Consent?,” by Roseanna Sommers (Op-Ed, March 6):Sorry, but this slope is way too slippery. Who among us has never said anything deceptive to improve the chances of sexual contact with someone we’ve just met?We exaggerate the importance of our jobs, and our prowess at tennis and chess. No matter how cantankerous we might be, we try to come off as cheerful. We might nap and play video games, but we project ourselves as sociable and extroverted.Imagine someone bursting into a police station and declaring: “Officer! He said he loved Mozart, but he really loves Drake! Arrest him!”Sorry, folks, but even 13-year-old Juliet knew that seduction is all just a big scam. As she points out in the balcony scene, “At lovers’ perjuries, they say, Jove laughs.”
