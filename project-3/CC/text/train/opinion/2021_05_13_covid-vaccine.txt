Why I Am Not Vaccinated
To the Editor:Re “Our Herd Immunity Failure,” by David Brooks (column, May 7):I am one of the people who was interviewed and quoted in Derek Thompson’s Atlantic piece about Americans who are declining the vaccine, which Mr. Brooks discusses.I take issue with Mr. Brooks’s unflattering portrayal of us as a group of individuals who have failed to consider our obligation to society. I was a public defender in New York City for over eight years, a career I chose because I wanted to help the most powerless. I am currently an attorney at a civil liberties nonprofit.I strongly disagreed with the response of governments and communities throughout the world to the coronavirus crisis, because I believe that the measures implemented did little to reduce deaths from the virus, while they inflicted substantial harm, particularly on the most vulnerable: the poor, minorities, children and individuals suffering from depression and other mental illnesses, to name a few groups.With respect to my own decision not to get the vaccine, I had Covid in February, and therefore almost certainly am immune to infection.
