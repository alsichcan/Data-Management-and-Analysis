The Storm That Knocked Out Texas
To the Editor:Re “Misery Deepening in Texas as Storm Menaces the East; Officials Falsely Hold Windmills at Fault” (front page, Feb. 18):Once again, sympathies go to the millions suffering frigid Arctic air. This latest episode of extreme weather of unprecedented frequency, severity or duration, along with prior floods, windstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, heat waves and drought-caused firestorms and crop losses, have become the modern-era plagues of biblical proportions.This is the face of climate change; we could try getting used to it. Or, better, stop sending to so many state capitals and Washington politicians — in the pockets of fossil-fuel industries — who deny even the possibility of human-induced global weather weirding and are unwilling to undertake precautionary measures in case they are wrong.Bruce G. WenigerAtlantaTo the Editor:Re “Frigid Onslaught Stretches Limits of Electric Grids” (front page, Feb. 17):I am a Texan currently finishing a master’s degree in power and electrical engineering in Germany. During my studies, I have been able to learn how Germany and Europe are proactively modernizing their power networks to support our ever-increasing energy demands and the use of renewables.This week, I worry as both of my brothers, their families and others go without power. This severe winter storm has revealed weaknesses in Texas’ power grid. Even without extreme weather, rapid population growth is stressing Texas’ aging power network.
