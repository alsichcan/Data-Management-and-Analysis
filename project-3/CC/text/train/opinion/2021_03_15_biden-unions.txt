What Biden and F.D.R. May End Up Having in Common
Last week, President Biden issued a robust endorsement of the Protecting the Right to Organize Act, or PRO Act, the most far-reaching pro-union legislation in decades, which would make forming unions easier and make it harder for companies to fight against unionization.So far, he appears poised to deliver on his campaign pledge to “be the most pro-union president you’ve ever seen” — the sort of lofty promise made and later broken by recent presidents, Republican and Democratic alike.Some union leaders feared the same about President Biden, especially because of his close ties to corporations when he was a senator from Delaware. But late last month, he posted a two-minute video online that defended and praised unions. “Unions built the middle class,” Mr. Biden said. “Unions lift up workers, both union and nonunion, but especially Black and brown workers.”Although Mr. Biden didn’t mention the continuing drive to unionize almost 6,000 Amazon workers in Alabama, his remarks were widely seen as a boost to that campaign. He added that it was his “administration’s policy” to support union organizing and said employers shouldn’t use anti-union propaganda or intimidation to beat back unions.
