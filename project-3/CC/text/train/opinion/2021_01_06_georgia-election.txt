Messages in the Democratic Sweep in Georgia
To the Editor:Re “Democrats Capture the Senate as Ossoff Defeats Perdue” (nytimes.com, Jan. 6):Winning both seats in Georgia’s runoff election might do more than give Democrats control of the Senate when they can maintain solidarity on legislation. It could give permission or encouragement to a handful of Republican senators who may still have a periodic twinge of conscience and may have grown weary of Mitch McConnell’s cynical obstructionism. It could free them to vote with the opposition on the occasional legislation that they could admit would be good for the nation.It would also help diminish the toxic power of the former president. In fact, it might even help repair their own party in the long run.Tom HerzSan FranciscoTo the Editor:I grew up in Atlanta in the 1940s. Ralph McGill, legendary editor of The Atlanta Constitution, wrote about the New South. That vision felt like a mirage to most Georgians. The Ku Klux Klan had burned crosses at Stone Mountain; Georgia disenfranchised most Black voters; the lynching of Leo Frank, a Jewish factory superintendent, was not that long ago; and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was a teenager stepping into a sea of Jim Crow segregation and anti-Semitism.With the election of a Black and a Jewish senator in Georgia, McGill and King’s dream may be becoming real.
