A few minutes later, he had forgotten about the virus, and so the nursing aide told him again. And then again. She would have to tell him the next day, too.“It’s pretty quiet in here,” Mr. Williams said, biting the inside of his lip a little.“Well, we’ve got this virus.”On most days, after Mr. Williams forgets again about the virus, he gets out of his armchair and into his wheelchair and goes down the hallway at Brookestone View Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation. Like other residents with Alzheimer’s disease or dementia, he is “noncompliant” with mask-wearing protocols. He says the masks fog up his glasses. Or he thinks: What mask? He is also “noncompliant” with social-distancing measures.
