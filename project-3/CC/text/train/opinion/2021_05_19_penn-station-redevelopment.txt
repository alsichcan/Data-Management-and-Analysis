New York, Scrap the New Penn Station Plan
To the Editor:Re “A Plan to Rebuild Penn Station Would Start With 10 New Skyscrapers” (news article, May 6):The plan for the Penn Station neighborhood that Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s Empire State Development Corporation is pushing is bad indeed. It demolishes several fine urban blocks, barely improves train service and leaves Penn Station in the basement of Madison Square Garden.We wonder why the planners have not done a comprehensive cost-benefit analysis of the most promising alternative: a regional unified train system. The regional option is based on trains that stop at Penn Station on their way west rather than ending there.Building this cost-effective option would create a powerful engine of economic growth for the entire tristate region. It would be the kind of growth that spreads the benefits of prosperity to all rather than concentrates it in the hands of the skyscraper-owning elite.Moreover, this option would avoid demolition of historic buildings and the displacement of residents in what is now a thriving neighborhood.
