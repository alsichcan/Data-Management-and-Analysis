Keystone Kops Vaccine Rollout
To the Editor:Re “Older People Who Want Shots Run Into a Tangle of Red Tape” (front page, Jan. 15):Getting an appointment to get the Covid-19 vaccination in New York State involves multiple websites, links and surveys. One has to be computer literate and have some degree of health and general literacy, diligence and a lot of time to get an appointment; it appears that the convoluted systems were designed by the Keystone Kops or Lucy and Ethel.The couples I know who are 65 and over who are lucky enough to find an available site are getting the vaccine on different dates and at different facilities. This involves extra costs, traveling and virus exposure.And most important, what about the folks who lack the resources and time to manage the maze of online sources and information? Clearly, we need a much more organized and systematic approach.Michele G.
