Why So Many People Are Resisting Vaccination
Early in the 20th century, it was not uncommon for children to suffer the agonies of infectious diseases or witness family members who did. Children got terribly sick and died at home. Their survivors — including some of our grandparents and great-grandparents — were intimately acquainted with the sights, sounds and smells of dying and with the deaths of siblings or their own small children.Thankfully, those traumatic experiences are long past us. Americans born after the mid-20th century belong to the vaccine-spoiled generations. Most probably don’t know what diphtheria is or that it was a leading cause of childhood death in the United States before immunizations became widespread. Nor can they imagine being parents helplessly watching their small child cough to death from this bacterial infection.I came to this understanding while writing a short book about the Covid-19 pandemic. As I studied the politics and science of our national response, I became interested in how we came to forget our vulnerability and even disregard or grow suspicious of the vaccines that have saved countless lives. At the end of March, as we celebrated the medical milestone of the new mRNA vaccines — which instruct our cells how to make proteins that prompt an immune response against a virus — one in four Americans said they would decline the Covid-19 vaccines.The history of 20th-century vaccine developments was a seesaw of advances in medical science and distrust and conspiracy theories arising from vaccine mishaps or failures. New vaccines were almost always accompanied by reports of risks and side effects, and sometimes there were terrible accidents, at least one involving tens of thousands of people made ill by a vaccine that was supposed to protect them.
