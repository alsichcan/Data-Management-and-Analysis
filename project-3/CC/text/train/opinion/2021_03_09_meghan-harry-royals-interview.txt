After Meghan and Harry’s Interview: Sympathy and Cynicism
To the Editor:Re “In Britain, Meghan and Harry Talk Stirs Debate on Entrenched Racism” (news article, March 9):May I remind your readers that the vast majority of Brits welcomed Meghan to our island with heartfelt warmth? We found it genuinely exciting that she was an American of color and not from a superprivileged white background. We were overwhelmed by the unstuffy address by an American bishop, Michael Curry, at the wedding.Gradually, our love was eroded by her public actions, such as her inappropriate dress and behavior at Wimbledon, and, during a recession, spending millions of taxpayers’ money on refurbishing a perfectly acceptable home (we all remember that £5,000 copper bathtub).We watched the Oprah interview with cynicism. One small example: Meghan didn’t know she had to curtsy to Her Majesty. Really?Andy PalmerMappowder, EnglandTo the Editor:The royal family’s alleged behavior toward what they deemed as a foreign intrusion into their homogeneous family is once again a wake-up call for the entire world, including my country, Canada, to re-evaluate its connection with such an entity. Should we Canadians keep bowing to them in humility as we do when we take the oath of citizenship, or should we turn the page instead? We need to have a healthy discussion about the royal family’s relevance in today’s world.
