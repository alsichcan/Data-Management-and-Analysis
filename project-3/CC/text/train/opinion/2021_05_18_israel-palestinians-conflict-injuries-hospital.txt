I’m a Trauma Surgeon in Israel. In My Hospital, We Are in This Together.
HOLON, Israel — Late in the evening on Tuesday, I was working in my office in Wolfson Medical Center, the hospital where I am the director of trauma surgery. The sun had set and suddenly the sirens started blaring from every corner of Tel Aviv, warning of rockets headed our way.Our hospital is on the southern edge of the city, in a working-class neighborhood filled with Jews and Arabs, recent immigrants from sub-Saharan Africa and the countries of the former Soviet Union. From the hospital’s intercom came a calm, programmed voice: “Red alert,” it said. “Please move away from the windows and into a protected area as soon as possible.”I ran down the internal stairway to the emergency room and waited. Moments later I heard booms — some sounded distant, others sounded like they were right over our heads, a result of Israel’s Iron Dome antimissile system exploding rockets in the sky.After a while, things were quiet again. I walked outside to the entrance where the ambulances are. Medics — most of them volunteers, some as young as 15 — were running to their ambulances and speeding off; they wore bulletproof vests and helmets. One told me that a bus in a nearby neighborhood had been hit. There were casualties. The hospital staff knew that we had only minutes to prepare for the influx.
