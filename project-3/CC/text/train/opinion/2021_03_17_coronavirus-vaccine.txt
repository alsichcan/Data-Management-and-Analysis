Let Our Doses Go!
Finally, the United States appears to have an enviable record in one aspect of the pandemic.We are vaccinating our population at a rapid pace, and our supply has ramped up so much that the Biden administration predicts that by May, any adult in the United States will be eligible to get shots. Pfizer and Moderna are on track to deliver a total of 400 million doses by the end of May and 600 million by the end of July — that’s enough to fully vaccinate 300 million people. Johnson & Johnson says it will deliver 20 million doses this month, with tens of millions more on the way soon. Just those numbers would provide at least 80 million more vaccinations than are needed for everyone in America over the age of 16.Why, then, are we sitting on tens of millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine gathering dust in our warehouses when they could immediately be distributed elsewhere? As of one month ago, there were 130 countries that had not yet administered a single dose of any Covid-19 vaccines. It’s not that much better now.While not yet authorized by the Food and Drug Administration, and thus unavailable to be used in the United States, the AstraZeneca vaccine is already approved by the World Health Organization to be distributed as part of the Covax initiative to provide equitable global access to Covid-19 vaccines. So it could immediately start going to many countries that desperately need it right now. What’s more, it has much simpler storage requirements than other vaccines, which makes it less difficult to distribute.Unfortunately, the decision this week by several European countries to suspend its use because several recipients developed blood clots is only the latest in a variety of problems AstraZeneca has had in its trials, reporting and rollout. A dosing error in an initial trial muddied the interpretation of efficacy results; insufficient initial data on older populations made European regulators skeptical.
