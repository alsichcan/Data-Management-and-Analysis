Mexico’s President May Be Just Months Away From Gaining Total Control
MEXICO CITY — The year 2022 will mark 200 years of official relations between Mexico and the United States. But before we’re able to celebrate this milestone, we must first work to safeguard freedom, democracy and the rule of law in Mexico under President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s illiberal rule.On March 1, signaling a change in tone from former President Donald Trump’s disrespectful and transactional attitude toward Mexico, President Biden and Mr. López Obrador held a virtual meeting at which Mr. Biden pledged to honor their commitment to the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement and to discuss how they can work together on migration, coronavirus response and recovery and climate change.Mr. Biden would also do well to promote stricter gun laws to help stop the flow of guns from the United States. Mr. López Obrador, known as AMLO, in turn should dispel the uncertainty over Mexico’s energy sector, where new laws that strengthen the state-owned energy companies Pemex and C.F.E. and the use of fossil fuels, and that conflict with the U.S.M.C.A., have recently been passed.
