What the Pandemic Revealed About ‘Progressive’ Prosecutors
In late September, with the Covid-19 pandemic raging, District Attorney Larry Krasner of Philadelphia, a leader of the so-called progressive prosecutor movement, spoke to a national virtual audience at the prestigious Atlantic Festival.On the same day, we at the Philadelphia Bail Fund worked to ensure a Black woman’s release from jail by paying for her freedom. Unemployed and pregnant, she faced her first-ever criminal charges. But Mr. Krasner’s office requested a $999,999 bail, which would have kept her trapped in a mildewed, roach-infested jail, awaiting trial without having been convicted of a crime, while Covid threatened her and her baby.That juxtaposition — a “progressive” prosecutor lauded by the media while using the very practice he campaigned against to detain a poor, pregnant Black woman — is emblematic of the widening gap between the rhetoric and the reality of criminal justice reform.It reveals a jarring truth: In the midst of a pandemic, when bold, radical change is needed most, too many “progressive” prosecutors have largely not shown up as the heroes some hoped they would be. It has proved that there are sharp limits on the kind of change we can expect from prosecutors.
