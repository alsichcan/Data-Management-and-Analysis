Should Student Debt Be Canceled?
To the Editor:Re “Cancel Student Debt to Shrink the Racial Wealth Gap” (Op-Ed, Feb. 3):Professors Naomi Zewde and Darrick Hamilton propose that President Biden should “cancel all federal student debt through executive action.” Although the president is not likely to do that, he did propose a $10,000 loan forgiveness program based on congressional action. I hope that none of this happens.Across-the-board loan forgiveness is not very fair. For one thing, it offers nothing to those who did not attend college. It offers less than nothing to those who sacrificed mightily to pay off large student loans. Worse, it sends cash to all borrowers, independent of the borrowers’ need.But my dissent is more fundamental. There is a finite amount of money that taxpayers can provide. Especially with racial justice in mind, extending Covid relief, improving public K-12 education, subsidizing mass transit and increasing the supply of affordable housing all make a much stronger claim for support.Joseph BernsteinHaverford, Pa.To the Editor:Professors Naomi Zewde and Darrick Hamilton argue that canceling student debt would not only shrink the burden faced by millions of young Americans but would, at the same time, reduce the racial wealth divide. Student debt cancellation is a policy that benefits all groups but disproportionately those, like African-Americans, who suffer a wide wealth gap.
