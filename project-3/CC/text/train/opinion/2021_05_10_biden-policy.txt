Why Biden’s Plans Have Popular Appeal
To the Editor:Re “The Permanent Decline Biden’s Plan Promises” (column, May 4):Bret Stephens’s critique of President Biden’s proposals sounds much like the yearslong conservative jeremiad against the Affordable Care Act: “Repeal and Replace,” with not the faintest suggestion of an alternative plan.Mr. Stephens does not contend that there is no need for upgrades to child care, education and health care in the United States, nor could he. There is a reason that the Biden plans have such popular appeal, even among Republican voters. They address the everyday needs that decades of obeisance to single-minded free-market economy ideologists have neglected.This devotion to the almighty dollar may have produced tremendous wealth in this country, but that wealth has increasingly benefited a much smaller portion of our population.So, much as the New Deal and the Great Society programs served as springboards for the tremendous growth in our national economy and the growth of a large, healthier and better educated middle class, President Biden’s American Jobs Plan and American Families Plan are the answers to this generation’s crying needs.
