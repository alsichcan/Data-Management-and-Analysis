Hal Holbrook Inspired a Biography of Mark Twain
To the Editor:Re “Hal Holbrook, Actor Who Channeled Mark Twain, Is Dead at 95” (obituary, nytimes.com, Feb. 2):Mr. Holbrook’s portrayal of Mark Twain was not impersonation; it was possession.My late husband, Justin Kaplan, and I went to see Mr. Holbrook’s performance in 1956. Justin was so moved by what he saw and heard on that small stage in a hotel that he decided to write a biography of Twain.That book, “Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain,” my husband’s first effort, won both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize in 1967.To say that Mr. Holbrook’s performance was unforgettable is not doing it justice.Anne BernaysCambridge, Mass.
