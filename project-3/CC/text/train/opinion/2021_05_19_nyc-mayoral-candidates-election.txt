We’re Being Trampled by a Candidate Stampede
New York City has a very important mayoral election this year, which will very probably be decided in the June Democratic primary. Big debate coming up which voters will get to watch on …Oh no. Zoom.It’s true. You can now go to a bar without a mask in New York, but apparently the people who run our debates feel it would be too dangerous to allow the eight major mayoral candidates onstage together.I believe I speak for many voters when I say that, while health is certainly the top priority, you have to give a little consideration to the fact that trying to sort out eight candidates by what their little square heads are saying on a computer screen is … a challenge.It’s a tough year for responsible, hard-working voters. California has to decide whether Gov. Gavin Newsom should be given the heave-ho by recall. Lots of complaints from the right about Newsom’s tax and immigration policies, but his reputation went into a bipartisan nosedive when he was spotted having a maskless dinner with a bunch of well-to-do folks at a very fancy restaurant during the pandemic.
