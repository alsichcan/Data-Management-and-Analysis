Who Is to Blame for the American Diet?
To the Editor:Re “Why Your New Year’s Diet Is Doomed” (Op-Ed, Jan. 11):Bravo to Mark Bittman on an excellent analysis of why most people will fail most of the time when trying to improve their diets. As a pediatrician and a longtime board member of a major food organization that sponsors farmers’ markets and nutritional information, I could not agree more.Nutrition information is David to the industry’s Goliath. I fervently hope that President Biden’s agriculture secretary-designate, Tom Vilsack, will do much more than he did when he held the position previously.He can use the Agriculture Department to promulgate policies that use the broad sweep of the departments that Agriculture oversees to begin the long task of counteracting the food advertising budget’s hold on American eating habits.Barbara GoldPhiladelphiaTo the Editor:Mark Bittman is right to point out how much processed, low-nutrition “junk” is in the American diet.
