Our Year of Mutual Aid
CHICAGO — “Free foooood!” It was a hot morning in late July, and many were gathered outside an elementary school to distribute groceries to the community. The D.J. played Beyoncé’s “Before I Let Go” as volunteers and people in line danced, six feet apart. Children of the neighborhood ran by to get snack packs and coloring books, and stayed to help elders carry their groceries. Regulars sat out in their chairs, just as they do every Monday.This was the scene at the People’s Grab-n-Go, a Black-led mutual aid program on the South Side of Chicago that provided groceries and household goods to over 5,000 families last summer. Late at night on the eve of June 1, amid citywide protests, Chicago Public Schools announced a suspension of its 300 free-meal sites. It came at a time when grocery stores in Black neighborhoods were closing down, too, in reaction to looting.If our public institutions wouldn’t provide, we would. The next day, a few of us put out a call to show up outside a school with food. What we imagined would be sandwiches and snacks swiftly turned into groceries and essentials, and the outpouring of need and support persuaded us to make it a summer-long project. The first week we popped up, over 600 people lined up around the block, and dozens of friends drove in from parts of the city where there were open grocery stores to supply our neighbors with water bottles, diapers and pantry staples.The Grab-n-Go was a project of young Black prison abolitionists: A neighborhood over, collaborators were mobilizing the resources of a handful of nonprofits to create a recurring food delivery program called Market Box. The project worked with Star Farm Chicago, a nonprofit urban farm on the South Side, which scaled its packing and distribution to add our funded deliveries to its roster.
