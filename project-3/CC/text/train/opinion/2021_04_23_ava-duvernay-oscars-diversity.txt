Ava DuVernay Isn’t Up for an Oscar, but It’s Still Her Night
Ava DuVernay isn’t up for an Oscar this year, but it’ll probably still be a satisfying evening for the acclaimed director: She had a hand in or actively championed five films nominated for awards — genre-spanning works that take us from rural Rajasthan to South Central Los Angeles.In a year with one of the most diverse slates of nominees ever, Ms. DuVernay’s influence is unmistakable. After a relatively brief time in the movie industry establishment — less than a decade — Ms. DuVernay has emerged as a powerful champion of talented, younger, mostly Black filmmakers. Bit by bit, she’s building the Hollywood she wants to see.It’s not easy to change entrenched norms in any industry. But being an outsider who has risen to a powerful position offers a particular perspective. Instead of fighting for your spot in the hierarchy by punching down, you can increase your influence by extending a hand.“I think in 20 years we’re going to have a generation of filmmakers of color who all got to where we are because of Ava,” said Kris Bowers, a 32-year-old Black composer and filmmaker who is among Ms. DuVernay’s protégés, and who co-directed The Times’s Op-Doc “A Concerto Is a Conversation,” an Oscar nominee this year. (I helped produce the film for The Times.) “She’s reached out to us and said, ‘I can see in you what you can’t see for yourself — or maybe you can, but you’re still exploring — and I’m going to give you the tools to grow and flourish in it.’ I didn’t realize how much I needed that.”
