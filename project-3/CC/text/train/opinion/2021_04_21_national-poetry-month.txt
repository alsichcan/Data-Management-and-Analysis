Thank Goodness for Poetry
I don’t write poetry, and until recently, I didn’t read it. Poetry is too beautiful, and I’m too self-conscious to try to create it. So when I was approached by a foundation to create an animated video series for National Poetry Month, I immediately thought no.For the past 12 months, I’ve overworked myself to avoid any pauses in the day where feelings might creep in. Because how can I make sense of this year? If I try, I’m pretty sure my mind might short-circuit, that smoke will spill out of my ears and the room will smell of burning plastic.But then I spent some time with these works. They were chosen by the contemporary American poets who lent their voice to the videos, because the verses were helping them puzzle through their feelings about this past year (you can read what they had to say about the poems below). I also started to find the answers in these poems. A poem is a timeless place, an immaterial plot of land where we can gather across generations to breathe and feel, deeply and safely.
