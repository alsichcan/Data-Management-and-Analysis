Read the Legalese? Nah, Just Click ‘Agree’
To the Editor:Re “It’s Time to Fix the Fine Print” (editorial, Jan. 24):Everyone knows that we have neither read nor understood the terms in service contracts, but we are required to attest that we have. As we mourn the demise of veracity and integrity in our public discourse, perhaps we should consider the implications of requiring mendacity as a precondition for using the tools and services of modern life. Weren’t we taught not to lie?Ezra D. HausmanAuburndale, Mass.To the Editor:I agree about the impossibility of reading the lengthy and complicated clauses buried in the terms of service of tech contracts. One just gives up in defeat and clicks “agree.” The situation is even worse for patients in the hospital — who are routinely faced with documents containing many pages of small print.Even if the patient is feeling calm (unlikely) and can find his glasses (perhaps), it is not likely that he will feel comfortable making the team of medical personnel wait while he tries to read and understand the documents before he signs them. And, in a hospital, the documents can, literally, have life and death (as well as financial) implications.Alice L. GivanBrooklynTo the Editor:Standard terms contracts have been an issue for a century — long before the tech giants existed.
