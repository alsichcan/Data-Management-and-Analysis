The Supreme Court After Trump
I’ve been wondering what Chief Justice John Roberts thinks about his former law clerk, Senator Josh Hawley.I don’t mean to sound snarky, and I’m certainly not implying that the chief justice bears the slightest responsibility for his law clerk’s subsequent effort to overthrow a democratic election.Rather, I mean to open the door to a deeper inquiry: Now that the Trump presidency has disintegrated into mayhem and madness, how are the conservative members of the Supreme Court processing these past four years?The court has been Donald Trump’s enabler to an unfortunate degree, from upholding his Muslim ban, in one of the sorriest excuses for a Supreme Court decision in recent years, to permitting him to spend money that Congress had not appropriated in order to build his border wall in a location Congress had forbidden. And let’s not forget last summer’s decision upholding the administration’s policy to permit employers with a religious or even just a “moral” objection to contraception to withhold from female employees an insurance benefit to which the Affordable Care Act entitles them.
