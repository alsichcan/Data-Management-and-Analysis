A Code to Live By: What Is Yours?
We invite readers to step back from day-to-day events and consider: What is your guiding philosophy or the personal code you live by? How does it play out in your life? Feel free to mention if and how it has been affected by your experiences over the past year.Submissions should be no more than 200 words. The deadline is Tuesday at 10 a.m., Eastern time.Email: letters@nytimes.comPlease include your name, city, state and contact information, and put “philosophy” in the subject line.We’d like to thank Katia Kriakova, a 14-year-old student from Boulder, Colo., for suggesting this idea, which she called Perspectives. “I know it’s crazy to be emailing such a big company,” she wrote. “But this is worth reading and taking some time to do! I’m only 14 but I know how much it would mean for people.”
