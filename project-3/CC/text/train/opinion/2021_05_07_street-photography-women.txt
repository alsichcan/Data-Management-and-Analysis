Finding Beauty in the Ordinary
Photographers tell a story through a single image. We wait patiently, anticipating the moment, and working with the light and space available. There is much debate around what defines street photography. But what I love most about it is how accessible the format is. The photographer moves through public spaces, observing, engaging, capturing beauty in the seemingly â€” the unexpected moments of joy among the mundane.
