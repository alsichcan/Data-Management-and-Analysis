Electric Cars and a Cleaner Energy Future
To the Editor:Re “G.M. Phasing Out Cars and Trucks Using Gas by 2035” (front page, Jan. 29):Bravo to General Motors for leading automakers toward an all-electric future. But even as more follow suit, let’s remember that electric vehicles are only as clean as their energy sources. And these sources will continue to extract energy from carbon-polluting fuels so long as our markets neglect their true costs to society.We must urge Congress to fix this market problem. Before us are legislative solutions like the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which places a fee on carbon pollution and returns the collected money back to Americans. If enacted, this policy will help put tailpipe emissions in our rearview mirrors for good, and clean up the energy sources that propel us forward.Adam ReedLongmont, Colo.The writer is a physicist with experience in clean-energy research.To the Editor:General Motors’ transition to an all-electric fleet is a critical step toward addressing the risks of global warming. But a large solar storm or electromagnetic pulse event could disable the entire transportation structure for months.True resilience is enhanced through diversity, in both power sources and engine types. Otherwise, the only vehicles left on the road will be a ’56 Chevy and a few riding lawn mowers.
