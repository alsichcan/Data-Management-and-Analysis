Hunter Biden, Matt Gaetz and Nonstop Depravity
WASHINGTON — A Twitter wag summed it up best: “Matt Gaetz is everything the Republicans were looking for in Hunter Biden.”The Times’s report about a federal investigation into whether the Florida congressman had a sexual relationship with a minor and paid for her to travel has set off a scandal worthy of a pulp paperback, one swirling with claims of extortion, Ecstasy, an orgy, a hula hoop and sex trafficking, along with an Iranian hostage and, of course, a cameo by Roger Stone.We are awash in sordid tales of Gaetz — the Beavis to Donald Trump’s Butt-Head — creating a point system for sexual conquests and showing nude photos of women to other (often appalled) lawmakers on the House floor.The moment crystallizes Republican hypocrisy. Trump and Gaetz viciously beat up on Hunter Biden, undeterred by their own vices.
