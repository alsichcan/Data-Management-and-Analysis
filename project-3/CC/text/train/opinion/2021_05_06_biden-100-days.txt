You Really Shouldn’t Care About a President’s First 100 Days
On July 8, 1815, Louis XVIII returned to Paris less than four months after Napoleon’s daring escape from exile drove the French king from the city. In that astonishingly brief time, Napoleon reclaimed his power, led French troops into the field against the united powers of Europe and was defeated, finally, at Waterloo. The French call this frantic interval Les Cent Jours, the 100 days.The monarchical origins of the phrase should be a warning against its use to measure the success of American presidents. But last week, news organizations, including this one, marked President Biden’s 100th day in office with everything from videos to scorecards to opinion polls. Mr. Biden commemorated it too, delivering an address to Congress laced with references to what had happened in the “100 days since I took the oath of office.”Having gotten that ritual out of the way, could we please retire the first-100-days standard? Judging presidents on that clock distorts politics by encouraging occupants of the White House to change as much as possible as quickly as possible.The 100-days benchmark entered American politics when Franklin Roosevelt used it in a fireside chat to characterize the special session of Congress he called to pass the New Deal. Since then, the 100th day of a term has become an arbitrary moment for gauging the success of a new president.
