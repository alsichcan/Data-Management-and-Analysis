Devoted to Trump, Not to the Republican Party
To the Editor:Re “Trump’s G.O.P. Hit List in Speech Puts Party on Campaign Notice” (news article, March 1):Joseph Conrad wrote, “The leaders of men are carried forward in the hands of their followers.” Never was this more true than with Donald Trump.It should come as no surprise that he doesn’t intend to start a third party. Why should he when, by owning the allegiance of his millions of Republican followers, he owns a perfectly good party of his own?Mr. Trump’s obsession with Republicans in Name Only is interesting, because it is not his enemies within the party who are RINOs, but rather his followers. Their only loyalty is to Mr. Trump himself, and their only concern is carrying him forward. They couldn’t care less about the Republican Party.There is something deeply disturbing and un-American in this devotion to an individual rather than a party, a tradition or set of beliefs.
