7 Myths About the Coronavirus Vaccine
As the vaccines for the coronavirus become more ubiquitous, so do misinformation, myths and misconceptions about them. This is unfortunate, because these untruths delay acceptance of the vaccines, and widespread immunization is the fastest and best way to begin to return to a more normal way of life. Seven of the most common myths I’ve heard from patients, friends and colleagues follow, along with my rebuttals.For some reason, this is the most common false assertion I hear. Sometime last year, a German doctor and a former Pfizer employee raised a concern that the coronavirus’s spike protein — the material that makes up those sharp protruding bumps you see in depictions of the virus — was in some ways similar to a protein that is part of a healthy placenta’s functioning during pregnancy. Therefore, they ventured, developing antibodies to the spike protein from a vaccine could lead to antibodies that might also attack a woman’s body when she was pregnant or trying to get pregnant, leading to complications. This theory is now widely circulated.It is mistaken. The two spike proteins are distinct, and there is no evidence that the vaccination leads to antibodies that attack the placenta.While the Pfizer trial of its vaccine attempted to exclude pregnant women, 23 pregnant women were a part of it, probably having gotten pregnant soon after vaccination. Two adverse events were seen in the trials: a spontaneous abortion and retained products of conception (placental or fetal tissue that remains in the uterus, often after miscarriage); both occurred in the placebo group. Anthony Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser for the pandemic, said on Wednesday that more than 10,000 pregnant women have received the vaccine with “thus far no red flags.”
