What We Lose When Only Men Write About Men
In “The Aspern Papers,” the Henry James novella of literary obsession, a biographer becomes fixated on a stash of secret letters belonging to an elderly woman who was once his subject’s girlfriend. Abandoning all his moral scruples, he persuades her to take him in as her tenant and pretends to court her niece.The book is said to be inspired in part by an anecdote about a fan of Percy Bysshe Shelley who made a similar attempt to win over a former associate of the poet. The methods by which some biographers gain access to material today are hardly more admirable.This is especially true in the murky world of literary biography, in which literary agents and executors dole out access to prestigious writers or their papers based on opaque criteria. Some biographers try to dodge these gatekeepers by writing “unauthorized” biographies, but this may mean not being able to see diaries, letters and other unpublished materials.It’s perfectly reasonable for executors charged with sensitive information to vet those who wish to use it. But this system too often rewards cronyism rather than hard work or creativity — and perpetuates the gross inequalities in representation that disfigure the American literary landscape.
