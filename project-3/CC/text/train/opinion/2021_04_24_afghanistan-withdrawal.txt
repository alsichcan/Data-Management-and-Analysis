Is Leaving Afghanistan the Right Move?
To the Editor:Re “Biden Ditches the Generals, Finally,” by Maureen Dowd (column, April 18):President Biden’s decision to remove the remaining American troops from Afghanistan is necessary and right, but tragic nonetheless. It’s necessary and right because the war is unwinnable at any level of troop strength.We may mourn the tragedy that will unfold when the Taliban again seize power, but should it be Americans’ job to avert that eventuality indefinitely? I for one am not about to volunteer for that mission, and I don’t feel that the brave women and men of our armed forces should be forced to either.It’s tragic for many reasons, not least because there are many wonderful people in Kabul who will be the target of a Taliban blood bath and a return to Taliban barbarism. We can expect that women will again lose all rights and be forbidden to work, and that schools for girls will be closed. To mitigate this disaster, President Biden should immediately establish a sizable quota for Afghan refugees and asylum seekers.Ed GogolCrystal Lake, Ill.To the Editor:While I largely agree with Maureen Dowd’s analysis, she leaves something out that is absolutely key to understanding NATO’s failures in Afghanistan: President George W. Bush’s decision to turn from finishing the job there to invading Iraq.
