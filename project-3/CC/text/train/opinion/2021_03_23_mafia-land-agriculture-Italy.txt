Fighting the Mafia on Its Own Turf
Francesco Citarda thinks the grapes in his Sicilian vineyard do more than produce excellent wine. In Alto Belice Corleonese, an area rived by the Mafia’s presence, Mr. Citarda says his co-op’s products can fight organized crime at its core.He’s a founding member of La Placido Rizzotto Libera Terra co-op. It produces goods from its arable land, winery and olive groves — and runs an agritourismo, a farm that hosts tourists. And all of it is done on a lush 618-acre estate the government confiscated from the Mafia.Set up in 2001, it was the first of nine co-ops of the network Libera Terra (Freed Land). The network shares know-how and resources among its co-ops and now employs about 170 people.Mr. Citarda says La Placido Rizzotto has brought change, in a region where the Mafia dominates socially and economically, ignoring local development and workers’ rights.
