Why Tucker Carlson Is Obsessed With Kristen Clarke
There are few people in the country today who have more experience fighting in the judicial trenches to preserve civil rights than Kristen Clarke, President Biden’s nominee to head the civil rights division of the Department of Justice.As the president and executive director of the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, Ms. Clarke filed or participated in more than a hundred lawsuits challenging efforts to make it more difficult to vote. During the 2020 presidential campaign, she seemed to be everywhere at once.In South Carolina, she represented the League of Women Voters, which sued because state election officials were poised to throw out absentee ballots for minor issues, like the loop of a letter in a signature. In Tennessee, she fought a law that required first-time voters to show up in person during a pandemic. And in Georgia, more than 800 voters contacted her organization’s hotline for help on Election Day.Ms. Clarke doesn’t fight just for Black voters. She fights for all voters to have greater access to the ballot box. That’s exactly what the head of the civil rights division ought to focus on. Ms. Clarke started her career in the voting rights section of Department of Justice, serving under both President Bill Clinton and George W. Bush.
