One Dose Now for Everyone Most Likely to Die
In the race to prevent ever more deaths from Covid-19, the United States faces two major problems: not having enough doses of vaccine on hand and struggling to deliver those that are available. According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as of Jan. 28 about 48.4 million doses had been distributed, but only 26.2 million administered.The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency-use authorization to two vaccines requiring two doses — with the first shot and the booster to be delivered three weeks apart in the case of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and four weeks apart for the Moderna vaccine.As of Thursday, just 4.2 million people in America had received both doses, according to the C.D.C. Uncertain about vaccine supplies, some inoculation centers have canceled first-time appointments while keeping second appointments on schedule.This is exactly backward.The Biden administration’s Covid-19 response and pandemic preparedness plan aims to provide 100 million doses within 100 days of the president’s inauguration, especially to people over 65, all essential workers (not only those in health care services) and “the highest-risk members of the public, including racial, ethnic and rural populations and those in congregate facilities.” Both the plan’s sense of urgency and its focus on some of the most vulnerable groups are welcome. But the proposal also backs the use of second doses and supports sticking to F.D.A.-recommended timelines for administering them, and that is misguided.
