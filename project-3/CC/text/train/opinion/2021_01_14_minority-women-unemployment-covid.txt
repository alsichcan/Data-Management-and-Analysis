Working Women of Color Were Making Progress. Then the Coronavirus Hit.
For years, the story of working women in the United States has been one of slow but steady progress. Against this backdrop, the latest monthly employment figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics delivered an acute shock.A net total of 144,00 jobs were lost in December, the clear effect of the continuing economic downturn. But while male employment increased slightly, 156,000 women lost their jobs, mainly in pandemic-hit sectors such as hospitality and education. And since the employment of white women actually increased, on net these losses fell on women of color.This is the scourge of the pandemic: It is landing multiple blows on those least able to bear them, widening inequalities stemming from gender, class and race.In recent decades, women in the work force have been on the ascent. In the late 1980s, womenâ€™s pay rose, on average, from about 62 cents for every dollar made by men to 81 cents. Their participation in the work force rose to just over 50 percent by the start of 2020, from 44 percent in 1972. Fifty-nine percent of Black women work, up from about 49 percent at the start of the 1970s. Similarly, 58 percent of Hispanic women work, up from 41 percent in 1972.
