I Miss a Lot of Things About the Office. My Breast Pump Isn’t One.
I miss my colleagues. I miss listening to podcasts during my morning commute. I miss water-cooler gossip. But you know what I don’t miss? My breast pump, the office lactation room, and most everything tied to being a nursing mom in the workplace.Hand and electric pumps were meant to free us from the nursing chair so that we could return to work while still providing nutritious breast milk to our babies. But ask any parent who has pumped at the office, and the stories you will hear rarely invoke the term “liberation.”Instead, we think of the embarrassing conversation we had with our boss, explaining that no, the bathroom would not be a suitable place to pump. We think of the time a non-lactating co-worker took a private phone call in the lactation room, or of pumping on the freeway or in an airplane window seat with a blanket draped awkwardly over the machine strapped to our chest.Lactation is a near-secret activity, rarely shown on TV or discussed beyond parent messaging boards, even though over 80 percent of American babies will be breastfed for some length of time. We remember inventing excuses for why we needed to slip away from a meeting or long conversation, not mentioning pumping for fear that a colleague might doubt our commitment to the job.
