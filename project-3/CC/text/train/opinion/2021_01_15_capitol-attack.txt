The Consequences of the Capitol Attack
To the Editor:President Trump and the Republicans have raised millions of dollars since the election, peddling their false narrative about voter fraud. Now that their supporters have ransacked the Capitol, they say that the time has come for national healing and reconciliation. An excellent first step in that process would be for Mr. Trump and the Republicans to voluntarily reimburse American taxpayers for the damage done to the Capitol by their supporters.Such a gesture would, of course, not recompense for the deaths and the harm done to our democratic institutions. But at least it would demonstrate that Mr. Trump and Republicans have some sense of responsibility.Dana GumbBayside, QueensTo the Editor:So who should be blamed most for the wild assault on the nation’s Capitol?Let’s go down the list: President Trump and his tweeting, Ted Cruz and his band of apologists for Mr. Trump’s attempted coup d’état, the Capitol Police, the many Republicans who did not dare to stand up to Mr. Trump’s provocations?None of these factors — except possibly Mr. Trump’s Twitter account, which has been suspended — comes close to playing as much of a role as the trio of bomb throwers at Fox News: Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson and Laura Ingraham. This irresponsible trio of Trump backers has done more to divide this country and stir up the animals within us than any other force.
