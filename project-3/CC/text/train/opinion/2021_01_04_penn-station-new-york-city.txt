Evoking the Grandeur of the Penn Station of Yore
To the Editor:Re “Penn Station Gets New Life Aboveground” (front page, Dec. 31):Let us celebrate the new Moynihan Train Hall while keeping our eyes on the prize. What is needed now is a fitting replacement for the subterranean rubble thrown to us when the original Pennsylvania Station was destroyed in 1963.I was given a tour of the train hall’s progress as it emerged from those parts of the James A. Farley Post Office no longer in use, and was deeply impressed with the architectural team’s reverence for that building’s bones. They understood that the past is a guidepost that helps define our future.When Charles McKim’s monumental gateway was reduced to memory, we lost a physical connection to our history. New York City has lived too long with the inadequate, pressed-down space that took its place.It is time to build a fitting Pennsylvania Station, one that uplifts us as it serves a vital and complex city.
