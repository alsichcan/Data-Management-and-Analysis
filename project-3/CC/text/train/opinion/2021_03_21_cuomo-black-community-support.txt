Exploiting Black Fears of False Persecution
Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been engulfed in scandal, not only over allegations that his administration misstated and attempted to conceal data about Covid-19-related nursing home deaths, but also over a steady stream of allegations of sexual misconduct.But last Thursday he went to Harlem to receive his vaccine shot, and there he was defended by some of his last and fiercest defenders: Black people.Charlie Rangel, the former member of Congress who was himself found guilty of 11 ethics charges in 2010 by the House ethics committee, defended Cuomo, saying that when people start “piling up” on you that “you go to your family, you go to your friends, because you know they will be with you.”This scene was in no way surprising. Liberal politicians, specifically Democratic men, will often lean on the Black community’s reticence to hastily judge and condemn. This is a reticence born out of a history of being falsely accused and persecuted and of needing a second chance to bounce back from the injustice.
