A.O.C. and Jamie Raskin Reveal That Politicians Are Real People
Representative Jamie Raskin of Maryland, the lead manager in the current impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, got the proceedings off to an emotional start on Tuesday. First, there was the prosecution’s opening video montage of the horrific events of Jan. 6 — 13 minutes of grisly, bloody footage from the assault on the Capitol by Mr. Trump’s supporters.Then came Mr. Raskin’s personal recollection of the attack, which had occurred one day after he and his wife buried their 25-year-old son, Tommy, who had died from suicide. For the counting of the Electoral College votes, Mr. Raskin brought his younger daughter and one of his sons-in-law to the Capitol. They were waiting for him in an office off the House floor when the rioters breached the building. Mr. Raskin recalled the horror of realizing that his family was in danger and that he could not get to them.The family members hid under a desk, sending “what they thought were their final texts,” he said. “They thought they were going to die.” Mr. Raskin grew emotional at times, wiping his eyes and stopping to compose himself as he recalled watching rioters use an American flag to “spear and pummel” a Capitol Police officer.Mr. Raskin is not the only lawmaker to get personal about that day. On Feb. 1, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the New York Democrat, spent 90 minutes on Instagram Live, recounting the details of her nightmare: hiding in her office bathroom, searching a colleague’s office for gym shoes in case she had to flee for her life, listening to the mob baying at the building’s door.
