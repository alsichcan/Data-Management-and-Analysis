Your Car, Toaster, Even Washing Machine, Can’t Work Without Them. And There’s a Global Shortage.
As the fallout from Covid wreaks havoc on supply chains, a major economic and geopolitical tug of war has broken out.The reason: a global shortage in the supply of semiconductors — the microchips at the heart of countless products in a modern economy. While companies potentially prepare to fight their suppliers and the United States threatens to bring production back home, Ford Motor said the shortage has slashed its profit forecast by more than $2 billion. Worse still, major producers like Intel and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company are warning that the shortage may last more than a year.How did we get here? Decades of underinvestment.Semiconductors are a roughly half-trillion-dollar industry, with opaque, byzantine supply chains. A widespread shortage makes it exceedingly difficult to buy a PlayStation 5 or the latest Nvidia graphics card. But it could also disrupt production of everything from 18-wheelers to medical equipment. Though there may be only one or two semiconductors in a given product, without them goods sit unfinished on the factory floor. Even worse, one chip often can’t be easily substituted for another.At the moment, the exact impact of the shortage on consumers is difficult to assess. That’s because reliable data is difficult to come by. Given the ubiquity of these chips, it’s shocking that even major companies may not know how vulnerable they are to disruptions in just a single factory.
