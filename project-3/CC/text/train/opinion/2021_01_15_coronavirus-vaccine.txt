Speed Up Vaccinations and Reduce the Red Tape
The debate goes on over the best vaccination strategy. Is it better to prioritize by age, since the disease is far more likely to seriously harm older people? How about essential workers — many of whom are poor people of color — since they suffer strikingly high rates of illness and death? Should everyone who works at a hospital be vaccinated, even those with no patient contact? And so on.These are valid questions, and while there is no one best way to roll out a vaccine in short supply, we’ve seen the wrong way — distributing it too slowly; setting up a complicated maze that needs to be navigated for access; and punitively micromanaging the process, which stalls it further.We should focus on speed and access, not on punitive efforts to ensure strict adherence to complicated eligibility rules. Micromanaging the vaccination process to make sure these rules are never departed from is more likely to contribute to slowing us down and wasting vaccines, not to fairness. It’s not our only challenge, but complicated prioritization and bureaucratization of the process is one of the reasons that while nearly 40 million doses have been distributed to states, according to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, only about 12 million have been administered, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports.As President-elect Joe Biden noted in outlining his plan to expand production and distribution of vaccines, that is a particularly dangerous gap because we are not only racing against time; now we also face a faster foe, at least one new variant that’s up to 50 percent more transmissible, which means many more infections, which would lead to more deaths.
