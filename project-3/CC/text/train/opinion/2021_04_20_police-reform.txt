Police Reforms That Might Actually Work
To the Editor:Re “New Police Reform Laws Seize on Calls for Change” (front page, April 19):We can train police officers from here until forever, but as long as police are humans their emotions will overtake their intelligence in emergencies. If we care about justice for our Black and brown citizens, it’s recruitment, not training, that needs to change.We need to send out on patrol only police officers who score low in anger, the need to control and personal anxiety. Only they can be expected to retain their cool in stressful situations.Their opposites will be unable to put aside personal insecurity well enough to even consider police-academy guidelines. We can’t train away human nature.Merrill HarminWhite Plains, N.Y.To the Editor:Certainly, the many types of police reforms that have been proposed and implemented in recent months are needed. However, these reforms are effective only to the degree that violations are reported and properly sanctioned.
