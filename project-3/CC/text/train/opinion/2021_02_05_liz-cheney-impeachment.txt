Liz Cheney’s Courage
To the Editor:Re “Even in Wyoming, Cheney’s Stance on Trump Is a Politically Perilous One” (news article, Feb. 3):Liz Cheney, chair of the House Republican Conference, displayed tremendous courage in voting to impeach President Donald Trump. Despite obvious potential pitfalls, Ms. Cheney threw political expediency to the wind and cast what she has termed a “vote of conscience.”More important, her statement preceding her vote was one of the most powerful any politician has ever delivered, paving the way for the most bipartisan vote to impeach a president in our nation’s history.Thankfully, other House Republicans showed bravery by choosing — albeit by secret ballot — to keep Ms. Cheney in her leadership post.
