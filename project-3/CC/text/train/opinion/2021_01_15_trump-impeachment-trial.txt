Impeachment Trial for Trump: Deterrent or Distraction?
To the Editor:Re “Parties Debate How to Handle Trial in Senate” (front page, Jan. 15):I voted for Joe Biden, but I’d like to see President Biden pardon Donald Trump as one of his first acts. I don’t say this because I think Mr. Trump deserves a pardon. A trial is a distraction we don’t need at a time when Congress should be focused on ending the virus and helping keep people afloat financially. As a practical matter, the Senate isn’t going to convict Donald Trump anyway, and a trial only exacerbates the division that already exists between the parties.A pardon demonstrates that Joe Biden will be running the country, not Nancy Pelosi. A pardon connotes that Donald Trump is guilty. A pardon shows that politics takes a back seat to what’s good for the country.Pardon Mr. Trump, and let’s move forward as one country with Mr. Trump in the rear view mirror.George ThompsonSanibel, Fla.To the Editor:The article says it “remained unclear whether the 17 Republican senators whose votes would be needed to convict Mr. Trump by the requisite two-thirds majority would agree to find him guilty.”
