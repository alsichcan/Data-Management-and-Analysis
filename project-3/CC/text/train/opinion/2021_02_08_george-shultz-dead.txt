He Helped End the Cold War With Kindness
George Shultz, a long-serving secretary of state under President Ronald Reagan, died on Saturday at age 100. A man of many achievements — he also held three cabinet posts under President Richard Nixon — there’s one for which he never received full credit: winding down the Cold War.Without Mr. Shultz’s steady guidance, Reagan could not have capitalized on the opportunity presented when Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union in 1985. “Without Reagan the Cold War would not have ended,” Mr. Gorbachev himself said a few years ago. “But without Shultz, Reagan would not have ended the Cold War.”It was the way in which he found success that made Mr. Shultz exceptional. He could be coldblooded, obdurate and inscrutable, but whenever the opportunity arose to connect with someone on a personal level, he embraced it. The human touch was at the heart of all Mr. Shultz did. His gestures of kindness and respect seem almost quaint now, a throwback to a gentler age when venom was not the elixir of public discourse.Take the time he brought James Goodby, a senior Reagan administration arms control negotiator, to the Oval Office for a meeting with Reagan. Mr. Shultz guided Mr. Goodby to the wingback chair next to the president, the seat reserved for the highest ranking guest. Mr. Shultz sat on the sofa. Mr. Goodby never forgot the gesture.
