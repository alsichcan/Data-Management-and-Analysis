Why Charles Koch Wins When Our Energy System Breaks Down
When the Colonial Pipeline shut down in 2016, it sent a grave warning about America’s fragile energy system. Once the gasoline stopped flowing, thanks to an accidental breach by a construction crew in Alabama, millions of people along the East Coast who relied on the nearly 60-year-old, 5,500-mile-long sometimes leaky pipe for their daily energy needs suddenly felt marooned. Backup supplies dropped. Prices spiked in some markets.It seemed like the sort of crisis that might spur some hard thinking about America’s energy infrastructure. Instead, after the gas started flowing again, everyone seemed to forget the pipeline even existed.That changed last week when a cyberattack crippled the pipeline, once again forcing its closure. Familiar scenes played out: long lines at gas stations in states like Georgia and South Carolina, with frustrated motorists and “out of service” signs hanging on empty pumps. Although Colonial restarted operations on Wednesday evening, it could take days to restore full service after the long closure.In the United States, we live in the worst of all energy worlds, one whose fate hinges on an aging, increasingly unreliable fossil fuel infrastructure dominated by a very small group of very profitable corporations. Yet lawmakers, paralyzed by political fights fueled by these entrenched corporations that profit from the status quo, are often unwilling or unable to either fix the system or build something new.
