There’s a Step Biden Can Take to Help Workers, and He Hasn’t Done It
Since foiling Donald Trump’s bid for a second term, Joe Biden has gone out of his way to send working-class voters the message that he, and not his predecessor, is the true champion of their interests. Shortly after he was inaugurated, Mr. Biden signed an executive order to encourage the federal government and federal contractors to pay their workers a $15 minimum hourly wage. He fired the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board, an anti-union lawyer and a Trump appointee. In a video tweeted in late February, Mr. Biden paid homage to unions and warned employers that there should be “no intimidation, no coercion, no threats” when workers exercise their collective bargaining rights.Mr. Biden’s video did not explicitly refer to a valiant but ultimately unsuccessful organizing effort at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Ala. But along with his other statements and actions, it marked a notable shift from the more tepid relationship with organized labor that has prevailed under some recent Democratic presidents, including Barack Obama. It also signaled a decisive break with the priorities of Mr. Trump, who rewarded his working-class supporters by cutting taxes for the rich and gutting worker protections.But there is one notable change that the Biden administration has not yet made: issuing an emergency temporary standard that would require employers to protect workers from exposure to the coronavirus by taking actions such as instituting mask-wearing requirements and social-distancing rules.A year ago, union leaders and workers’ rights advocates pressed the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to address the worst occupational health crisis since the agency’s founding in 1971. Their appeals fell on deaf ears. Instead, OSHA issued toothless guidelines that employers were explicitly told were voluntary and created no legal obligations.
