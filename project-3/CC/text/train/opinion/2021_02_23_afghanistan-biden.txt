Biden and the Afghan War
To the Editor:Re “Test for Biden: Can U.S. Exit Afghanistan?” (front page, Feb. 17):President Biden inherited an unenviable choice in Afghanistan, but if he forfeits the opportunity to exit by May 1 as agreed to last year, he will find his legacy tarnished by the decision to continue America’s longest active war.Your coverage describes the evacuation of Saigon as a “searing symbol of a failed strategy” that haunts President Biden. But the true lesson of the U.S. war in Vietnam is not its end, but its brutal continuation for a decade. The U.S.-led war in Afghanistan has now lasted twice as long.President Biden will own all future American casualties if he chooses to remain beyond May. A decision to send more troops or compensate with airstrikes will plunge Afghans and U.S. soldiers back in the crossfire of a reanimated U.S.-led counterinsurgency.I witnessed the futility of this counterinsurgency while serving in Afghanistan as a Marine. It is time to end America’s military role in the war in Afghanistan.
