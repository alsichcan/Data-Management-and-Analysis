The Rise of ‘Woke Capital’ Is Nothing to Celebrate
Has there ever been a threat so toothless, so risible, so obviously meek as the one issued of late to American businesses by miffed Republican senators?“My warning, if you will, to corporate America is to stay out of politics,” Senator Mitch McConnell recently told reporters. “I’m not talking about political contributions,” he then clarified, in case anyone had mistaken the bark for bite.Senator Rick Scott of Florida likewise warned of a “massive backlash coming” for “woke corporate America”; meanwhile, Senator Marco Rubio reckoned that “the bill is coming due” for companies that haven’t fulfilled their “patriotic role.”The lovers’ quarrel between big business and the right has been long in the making, but the current tiff emerged from corporations’ attempt to veto Georgia’s legislative effort to limit voter turnout. As other states, like Texas, consider Georgia-esque legislation, dozens of executives have put their heads together on a conference call to consider how best to turn back the tide of anti-democratic laws.
