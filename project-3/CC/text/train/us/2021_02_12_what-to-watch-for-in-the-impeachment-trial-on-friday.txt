What to watch for in the impeachment trial on Friday.
Lawyers for former President Donald J. Trump will have their first chance on Friday to counter the claim that Democratic House impeachment managers have sought to establish this week: that he was personally responsible for inciting the mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan 6.As House prosecutors wrapped up their arguments on Thursday, they gave no indication that they planned to call witnesses. Mr. Trump’s lawyers have also shown little interest in prolonging the proceedings. One of them, David I. Schoen, said on Thursday that he expected his team might use as few as three or four hours to mount its defense on Friday.The Senate will reconvene at noon.What will Trump’s defense look like?From the outset, Mr. Trump’s lawyers have contended that impeaching a former president is improper and unconstitutional, and a number of prominent Republican senators have echoed that stance. That argument may continue to be the keystone of the defense team’s case on Friday.Mr. Trump’s lawyers may also seek to argue that the former president was never in control of his supporters’ actions, and that his expressions of frustration about the election were not overt calls to violence but opinions protected as free speech under the Constitution.
