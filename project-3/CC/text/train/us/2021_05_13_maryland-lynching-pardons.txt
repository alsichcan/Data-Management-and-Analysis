‘A Measure of Peace’ for Families of Maryland Lynching Victims
About a decade ago, Tina Johnson of Princess Anne, Md., was taking a college course on the history of her state when she came across a familiar name.A passage in her textbook said that a young man named George Armwood was the last Black person to be lynched in Maryland. In class, Ms. Johnson raised her hand. “That’s my cousin,” she recalled saying to the professor.Ms. Johnson, now 35, had heard about Mr. Armwood once before: She was a child when her grandmother Mary Braxton told her about the day he was accused of attacking a white woman in 1933.Ms. Braxton, who was Mr. Armwood’s first cousin, told Ms. Johnson that he had asserted his innocence and tried desperately to hide from the police. He was ultimately taken to a jail in Princess Anne, where a lynch mob found him.
