Remains Found 36 Years Ago in Montana Are Identified
The authorities in Montana said this week that they had used a DNA sample to identify human remains that were found more than three decades ago as those of a woman from Washington State whose family had last seen her in 1983.For decades, the skeletal remains had been known only as Christy Crystal Creek, after the location in rural Missoula County where a bear hunter had found them in 1985. Detectives had few leads, and a forensic anthropologist’s flawed analysis of the woman’s teeth further confused the investigation.Recently, however, investigators turned to her teeth again, extracting a genetic profile from one of her molars and uploading it to a genealogy database. That led the investigators to a cousin who connected them with the woman’s siblings.The Missoula County Sheriff’s Office announced on Monday that Christy Crystal Creek was Janet Lee Lucas, of Spokane, Wash. The revelation solved a mystery that had bedeviled investigators for decades and that, more recently, was the subject of a true-crime podcast.
