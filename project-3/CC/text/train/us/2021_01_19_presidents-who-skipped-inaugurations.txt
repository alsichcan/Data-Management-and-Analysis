Trump Is Not the First President to Snub an Inauguration
[Here’s how to watch the Biden inauguration.]The inauguration of an American president typically takes place at a public ceremony marked by pomp, circumstance and the presence of a predecessor.This has been the custom for about two centuries: a show of participation from the departing head of state that symbolizes the peaceful transfer of power. When President Donald J. Trump promised to put an end to “American carnage” in his inauguration speech on Jan. 20, 2017, former President Barack Obama looked on from a seat just beyond Mr. Trump’s left shoulder.President Biden., who attended that inauguration as the former vice president four years ago, took his own oath of office on Wednesday. But Mr. Trump was absent. And while that decision is a break from the norm, it is not without precedent: A handful of American presidents have also missed the inaugurations of their successors.“It’s usually a sign that American society is in the midst of major political feud,” the presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said. “The fact that the incoming and outgoing presidents can’t shake hands and co-participate in an inauguration means that something’s off-kilter in the democracy.”
