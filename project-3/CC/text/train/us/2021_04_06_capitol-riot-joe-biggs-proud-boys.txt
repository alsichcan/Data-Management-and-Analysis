Capitol Rioters Face the Consequences of Their Selfie Sabotage
WASHINGTON — On Jan. 6, Joe Biggs, a former Army staff sergeant turned Proud Boys lieutenant, led the far-right group to the Capitol from the Washington Monument, charged over the wreckage of police barricades, pulled down another barrier, faced off with the police and then filmed himself.“We’ve just taken the Capitol!” Mr. Biggs shouted to the world.All that was laid out in court documents, but it was also in plain view. Mr. Biggs, indicted last month on charges that included conspiracy and destruction of government property, potentially faces decades in prison for his role in the Capitol riot.He has himself to blame. Like other Proud Boys, he helped document the prosecution's case.“Wanting to show how smart they are, they’ve basically outlined the charges against them,” said Grant Fredericks, a forensic video analyst in Seattle who examined the online evidence against Mr. Biggs and Proud Boys facing similar charges.The Justice Department predicted last month that the Capitol attack investigation and prosecution would be one of the largest in U.S. history. In Mr. Biggs’s case, prosecutors are relying heavily on private communications obtained through search warrants.
