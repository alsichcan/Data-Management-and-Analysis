Lafayette Park, which was closed amid protests at the White House last year, partially reopens.
Portions of Lafayette Square, the park in the shadow of the White House, reopened on Monday, more than 11 months after violent clashes there between protesters and law enforcement.The park, which sits on the north side of the White House, had been fenced off to the public in June, days after William P. Barr, then the attorney general, ordered officials to clear the park of people protesting the police killings of George Floyd and other Black men. Shortly after the authorities used riot-control methods to disperse the protesters, President Donald J. Trump strode across Lafayette Square to pose in front of a church that had been damaged by fire the evening before.In the months after the conflict, black metal fencing that had been quickly erected around the park became an impromptu memorial and art space.On Monday, the Secret Service did not say why the park had been opened to pedestrians and bicyclists.
