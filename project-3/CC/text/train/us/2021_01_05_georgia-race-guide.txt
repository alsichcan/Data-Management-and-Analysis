Georgia Senate Runoffs: What to Watch For
Two months after the presidential election, Georgia voters will decide in two runoff elections on Tuesday which party controls the Senate, determining how much President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. can accomplish during his first two years in the White House.Because of a fluke of scheduling and the 2019 retirement of Senator Johnny Isakson, a Republican, both Senate seats in Georgia were on the 2020 ballot. If the Democratic candidates, Jon Ossoff, a documentary film executive, and the Rev. Raphael Warnock, a minister, win, Democrats will hold sway over the Senate by a single vote. If either of the Republicans —Senator Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue, whose Senate term expired over the weekend — prevail, Republicans will retain their Senate majority.Georgia law requires candidates to capture at least 50 percent of the vote to be declared a winner — a vestige of segregation-era policies designed to prevent Black candidates from sneaking through a crowded field of white opponents.Neither of the state’s Senate races reached that threshold in November, forcing both into runoffs. Mr. Perdue is facing Mr. Ossoff in a regularly scheduled contest, and Ms. Loeffler, who was appointed to Mr. Isakson’s seat in December 2019, is vying against Mr. Warnock, who leads the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, in a special election.
