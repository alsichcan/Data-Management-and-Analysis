As McCarthy sets Wednesday vote to oust Cheney, he insists Republicans are ‘a big tent party.’
Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the top House Republican, on Monday defended his move to oust Representative Liz Cheney of Wyoming as the party’s No. 3 leader, portraying the purge of the most powerful Republican critic of Donald J. Trump as the forward-looking move of a “big tent party.”In a letter to colleagues announcing a Wednesday vote to “recall” Ms. Cheney, Mr. McCarthy said her ouster was necessary to overcome “internal divisions” that could derail the party’s efforts to reclaim the House majority in 2022. Even as he argued for getting rid of Ms. Cheney, who has angered others in the G.O.P. with her refusal to stay silent in the face of Mr. Trump’s election lies, Mr. McCarthy insisted that Republicans “embrace free thought and debate.”“Each day spent relitigating the past is one day less we have to seize the future,” Mr. McCarthy wrote. “If we are to succeed in stopping the radical Democrat agenda from destroying our country, these internal conflicts need to be resolved so as to not detract from the efforts on our collective team.”The statement was an attempt to pre-emptively deflect criticism of a messy intraparty conflict that Mr. McCarthy is well aware could alienate some voters who are eager to move past Mr. Trump and his false election claims. It also threatens to undermine the party’s efforts to avoid talking about the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol by a mob inspired by the myth of a stolen election.
