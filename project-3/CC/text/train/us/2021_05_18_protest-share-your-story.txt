Did You Join a Protest for the First Time Last Year? Share Your Story
We are approaching one year since the death of George Floyd at the hands of police set off the largest protest movement in U.S. history.Much has happened in the intervening months — an election; the ongoing pandemic; economic uncertainty; a national rise in gun violence; the deaths of Daunte Wright, Adam Toledo and others at the hands of police; and Derek Chauvin’s conviction for Mr. Floyd’s murder.We want to hear from people who joined protests last year for the first time, and whether that experience had a lasting impact on their lives. Did you face specific consequences for being involved in a protest, such as an arrest, the loss of a job or tension with family or neighbors? Did you meet people at that first protest that have since become part of your community? Did it prompt you to make big changes in your own life?
