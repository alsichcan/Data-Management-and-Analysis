Here is how Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine differs from Pfizer’s and Moderna’s.

Together with 600 million doses of the nation’s first two authorized vaccines, made by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, that are due to be delivered over the next four months, that ought to be enough to cover every American adult who wants to be vaccinated.The new vaccine differs markedly from the two already in use in the United States.
