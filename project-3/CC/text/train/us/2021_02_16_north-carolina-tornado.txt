A tornado in North Carolina kills at least three people.
A tornado tore through a coastal town in southeastern North Carolina just after midnight Tuesday, knocking down homes, killing at least three people and injuring 10 others, officials said.“We had very minimal warning,” said Edward Conrow, the director of emergency services in Brunswick County, adding that forecasters “were very surprised how rapidly the storm intensified. It is something they normally don’t see.”He said the tornado hit at a time when “most people are home and in bed, it creates a very dangerous situation.”Most of the damage and all of the fatalities were in the Ocean Ridge Plantation, a community located near Sunset Beach in Wilmington, Mr. Conrow said. There were no reports of anyone missing, he said.
