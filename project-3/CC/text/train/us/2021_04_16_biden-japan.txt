Biden and Suga Agree U.S. and Japan Will Work Together on 5G
WASHINGTON — President Biden and Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga of Japan pledged on Friday to work jointly on the rapid development of 5G communications technologies to prevent one of China’s leading companies from dominating the global market, a symbolic first move at shoring up an alliance that withered during the Trump administration.The agreement came as one of the prenegotiated outcomes of the first in-person visit of a foreign leader to Mr. Biden’s White House, after three months in which he talked to his overseas counterparts only by phone or video conference. For Mr. Suga, just appearing with Mr. Biden in the Rose Garden — where the president initially and mistakenly called him “Yosi” instead of “Yoshi” — was evidence that he had managed to preserve Japan’s most important international relationship despite one of the most difficult presidential transitions in history.“Our commitment to meet in person is indicative of the importance, the value we both place on this relationship,” Mr. Biden said. “We’re going to work together to prove that democracies can still compete and win in the 21st century.”But the subtext of the meeting was responding to China’s influence and its aggressive actions in the Indo-Pacific and beyond — which Mr. Biden regards as one of the key challenges of his time in office. And it was a careful dance, with Japanese officials wary of being drawn into the tensions with Beijing over Taiwan, the South China Sea and the rapid split between the West’s open internet and a Chinese government-dominated closed one.
