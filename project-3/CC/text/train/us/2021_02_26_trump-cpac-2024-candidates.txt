Trump to Dominate CPAC as Activists Assess Potential 2024 Candidates
After a month of operating uncharacteristically behind the scenes from Mar-a-Lago, Donald J. Trump will make the debut appearance of his post-presidency at the Conservative Political Action Conference on Sunday, and much as in the incipient 2024 presidential primary race, he is expected to overshadow the other Republican politicians who precede him.Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, whose state is playing host to CPAC, will kick off the conference on Friday and set the tone as the first in a parade of potential 2024 candidates to address the activist crowd. Among the others: Senators Ted Cruz of Texas, Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Josh Hawley of Missouri and Rick Scott of Florida, along with former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Gov. Kristi Noem of South Dakota. Here’s what to watch for this weekend.For the potential presidential hopefuls, the annual CPAC gathering represents a first chance to test their political messages and their appeal in a post-Trump era. It will also be a balancing act to find applause lines that are not simply pledges of fealty to Mr. Trump, the party’s most popular politician, or embracing of Mr. Trump’s baseless conspiracy theories that the 2020 election was stolen. Multiple panels over the weekend are slated to discuss election issues, with intentionally inflammatory titles like “Other Culprits: Why Judges & Media Refused to Look at the Evidence.”Though the Republican Party entered 2021 with gains in the House, it lost the Senate and the White House, and the party is facing deep questions about what it stands for after Mr. Trump, whose demands for loyalty came to define — and overturn — much of the party’s orthodoxies in the last five years.
