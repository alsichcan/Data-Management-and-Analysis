Trump Campaign Settles With Artist Who Said He Was Assaulted
President Trump’s campaign has settled a lawsuit filed by a Boston artist and documentary filmmaker who said he was assaulted by a staff member at an event in New Hampshire in 2015.Under a settlement agreement signed on Dec. 23, the Trump campaign agreed to pay the artist, Rod Webber, $20,000 in damages. The settlement does not include an admission of wrongdoing.The Trump campaign could not immediately be reached for comment.During the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Webber became known as the “Flower Man” for distributing flowers to major political candidates in what he said was a gesture of peace. He attended campaign events and asked the candidates questions.He also has a reputation as a provocateur. After a $120,000 duct-taped banana was eaten by a performance artist at the Art Basel fair in Miami Beach, Fla., last year, Mr. Webber wrote “Epstien didn’t kill himself” in red lipstick on the blank wall where it had hung, misspelling the name of the disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein. (A criminal mischief charge against Mr. Webber was dropped, CBS Miami reported.)
