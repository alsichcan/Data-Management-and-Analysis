Ole Anthony, Scourge of Televangelists, Dies at 82
Ole Anthony, a former Air Force intelligence specialist and Texas political operative who found Jesus in 1972, built a following among the down-and-out of east Dallas, and then used that movement to take down a rogue’s gallery of unscrupulous televangelists and faith healers, died on April 16 at a house in Dallas that he shared with several members of his organization, the Trinity Foundation. He was 82.His death was confirmed by Pete Evans, a Trinity member who, like Mr. Anthony, had taken a vow of poverty before acquiring a private investigator’s license, which let him peer deeper into the lifestyles of rich and famous preachers.Mr. Evans said that the cause had not been determined, but that Mr. Anthony had been in declining health since breaking his hip in 2020.A tall, blond, irascible son of Norwegian immigrants with an ever-present pipe, Mr. Anthony resembled both an Old Testament prophet and an Old West prospector — a fitting look for a man who, like a latter-day Jeremiah, believed it was his job to call out religious scam artists, especially those who had grown wealthy off their congregations.
