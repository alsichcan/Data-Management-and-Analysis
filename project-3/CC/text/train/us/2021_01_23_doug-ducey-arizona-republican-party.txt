How Doug Ducey, Arizona’s Republican Governor, Views His Party After Trump
Gov. Doug Ducey of Arizona drew criticism from some fellow Republicans in November for what in other years would merely be routine: certifying the state’s election. But it was only the second time a Democratic presidential candidate had won the state in 50 years, and many Republicans supported former President Donald J. Trump’s efforts to subvert the results.This weekend, the Arizona Republican Party is expected to censure Mr. Ducey, who easily won re-election in 2018, Cindy McCain and former Senator Jeff Flake during a state party meeting Saturday. Mr. Ducey, who said he considers himself a conservative Republican, has mostly tried to ignore the scolding and traveled to Washington to attend President Biden’s inauguration. We spoke with him about the political atmosphere in Arizona and nationally, and what the censure vote might mean for the G.O.P.’s future.The interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.What stood out to you about the president’s inauguration and your time there now?It’s incredibly special to be at any inauguration. I thought the president hit all the right notes in his speech. And it’s a new beginning for a new administration. It was incredible to me how locked down the city of Washington was, the amount of security that was there and armed troops on the streets along with the fencing and razor wire. And of course, that was in response to what happened a few weeks earlier.
