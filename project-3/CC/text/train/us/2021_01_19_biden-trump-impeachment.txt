Prosecute Trump? Biden Is Wary, but His Voters Are Eager
New presidents want to look forward, not back, and Joseph R. Biden Jr. is no exception, taking office with a lengthy menu of plans and an aggressive timetable for scrubbing away the policies of his predecessor.But Mr. Biden’s often-expressed desire not to dwell on the sins or even the potential crimes of President Trump, in the name of national unity, is clashing with the will of Democratic voters who want to fully air any wrongdoing and punish Mr. Trump and his enablers, after an election in which many Biden voters were inspired less by passion for him than by rage at the president.Starting with a split-screen inauguration week, in which Mr. Trump’s Senate impeachment trial could begin as soon as Thursday, the opening chapters of the new administration are likely to be marked by tension among Democrats about how to move forward. Party institutionalists led by Mr. Biden want to hammer out deals with congressional Republicans, while the Democratic base is eager for Mr. Trump, his allies and his family members to be held fully accountable.“Many of us voted to get Trump out, not necessarily to be pro-Biden,” said Nancy MacEoin, 47, a criminal defense lawyer in Philadelphia. “Backing off any sort of prosecution of Trump is going to alienate those people.”
