Biden marks Equal Pay Day with an event featuring soccer star Megan Rapinoe.
President Biden and Jill Biden, the first lady, delivered remarks on Wednesday that outlined the importance of equal pay for women after a year in which millions of them left the work force because of the pandemic.“This is personal to me, because it’s personal to all women,” Dr. Biden said during an afternoon event. “It’s one example of how we still treat women differently than men.”The Bidens delivered their remarks alongside Megan Rapinoe and Margaret Purce of the United States women’s soccer team, both of whom have been vocal in pushing for women athletes to be paid the same amount as male athletes.“This team is living proof that you can be the very best at what you do,” Mr. Biden said, “and still fight for equal pay.”
