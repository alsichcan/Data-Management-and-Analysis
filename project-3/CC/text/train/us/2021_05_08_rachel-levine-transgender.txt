‘This Is Politics’: Dr. Rachel Levine’s Rise as Transgender Issues Gain Prominence.
WASHINGTON — Dr. Rachel Levine was not a particularly aggressive football player at the elite all-boys school she attended in Massachusetts four decades ago. She loved drama and glee club, but when it came to football, she said, “I told the coach, ‘Well, I’ll tackle, but I don’t want to hurt them.’ ”Dr. Levine returned to Belmont Hill School as a guest speaker in 2016 and offered a little life advice to the boys clad in the same blue blazer and khaki pants uniform that she once wore: “Don’t make any assumptions.”Dr. Levine, a former Pennsylvania health secretary, is now President Biden’s assistant secretary for health, the first openly transgender person ever confirmed by the Senate, and she has taken office in the middle of something of a transgender moment. A culture war is intensifying, waged largely by Republicans who have sought in state after state to restrict transgender rights and block transgender girls from participating on girls’ sports teams.At the same time, a transgender woman, Caitlyn Jenner, the former Olympic decathlete and reality television star, announced last month she was running for California governor as a conservative Republican, a campaign that counts Brad Parscale, the former campaign manager for Donald J. Trump, as an adviser. Elliot Page, an Oscar-nominated actor, recently opened up about his gender-affirming surgery, telling Oprah Winfrey, “I do believe it’s been lifesaving.”
