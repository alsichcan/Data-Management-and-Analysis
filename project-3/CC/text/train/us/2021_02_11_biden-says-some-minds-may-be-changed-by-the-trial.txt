Biden says ‘some minds may be changed’ by the trial.
President Biden said on Thursday that “some minds may be changed” by Democratic House prosecutors at the impeachment trial of former President Donald J. Trump. But the comment, made off the cuff in a meeting with reporters, seemed to go against his administration’s strategy of willfully ignoring the proceedings.Just hours later, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, said she believed Mr. Biden had actually said “minds may be changed, or they may not.” She described his remarks as a “human” reaction to watching “harrowing” trial footage that should not be confused for political analysis. But she dodged questions on whether the president had an obligation to opine on the possibility of a conviction of his predecessor.“He’s not in the jury; he’s not in the Senate,” Ms. Psaki said. “His role is to be the president of the United States, and that is the role he currently plays.”Mr. Biden and his advisers have insisted for days that he is not paying close attention to the Senate trial of Mr. Trump. The president on Thursday hosted lawmakers for a discussion about infrastructure — and addressed the impeachment footage — and toured a laboratory at the National Institutes of Health.
