Federal Judge Bans Tear Gas on Nonviolent Protesters in Columbus
A federal judge has ordered the police in Columbus, Ohio, to stop using tear gas, pepper spray, batons and rubber bullets against nonviolent protesters, writing a scathing 88-page opinion that grapples with hundreds of years of police tactics and that says officers had “run amok” with power.Chief Judge Algenon L. Marbley of the Southern District of Ohio issued the opinion on Friday in the case, which began last year when demonstrators accused the Columbus Police Department of using excessive force during protests against police violence and the killing of George Floyd.The order is effective immediately, according to the city attorney’s office, though as a temporary injunction it holds only until the lawsuit is resolved. Legal analysts were struck by Judge Marbley’s unsparing rebuke of the police and the historical sweep of his opinion, which was issued as Columbus continued to grapple with accusations of police misconduct.Judge Marbley’s opinion begins with a quote from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. — “Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for rights” — and his swift invocation of the rights of the press, protest and speech.
