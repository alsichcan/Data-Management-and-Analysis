Scottish leader discourages supposed plan for Trump to travel to his golf resort before Biden’s inauguration.
LONDON — President Trump has not said where he plans to go after leaving the White House on Jan. 20. But Scotland’s first minister made clear on Tuesday that he is not welcome there.The official, Nicola Sturgeon, said that under newly imposed coronavirus restrictions, which prohibit all but essential travel, a visit by the president to one of his Scottish golf resorts, Trump Turnberry, would not be acceptable.Rumors that Mr. Trump would head for Scotland flared after a Scottish paper reported that an American military version of a Boeing 757 — sometimes used by Mr. Trump — was scheduled to land at a nearby airport on Jan. 19, the day before Joseph R. Biden Jr. is to be sworn in as president.“We are not allowing people to come into Scotland,” Ms. Sturgeon told reporters in Edinburgh, “and that would apply to him just as it applies to anybody else — and coming in to play golf is not what I would consider to be an essential purpose.”
