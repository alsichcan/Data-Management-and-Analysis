Biden’s honeymoon is over, but he retains majority approval, a poll found.
Whatever honeymoon period he may have briefly enjoyed, President Biden is now past it, according to the results of a Monmouth University poll released this week.Mr. Biden’s approval rating now stands at 51 percent nationwide, with 42 percent of the country disapproving, according to the poll, which was released on Wednesday. That’s a much narrower split than his 54 percent approval and 30 percent disapproval in another Monmouth survey that was conducted just after he took office.His handling of the coronavirus appears to earn higher marks: Sixty-two percent of respondents to a nationwide Kaiser Family Foundation poll, also released Wednesday, said that they approved of how the president was confronting the Covid-19 crisis; just 30 percent disapproved.More than nine in 10 Democrats said they liked how Mr. Biden was handling the pandemic, but just 22 percent of Republicans agreed, the Kaiser poll found. Notably, independents gave him positive marks on the issue by a two-to-one margin.
