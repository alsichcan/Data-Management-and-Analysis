Horse Fossil, Possibly From the Ice Age, Is Found in a Las Vegas Backyard
While digging in Matthew Perkins’s backyard last week in Las Vegas to build a pool, construction workers made an unexpected discovery: bones buried about five feet deep in the soil.When the foreman arrived a few days later, he came with officers and crime scene investigators from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department. They determined that the bones were too big to be human and told Mr. Perkins he could do whatever he wanted with them.“That was a huge shock to us,” said Mr. Perkins, 35, who moved to Las Vegas last year with his husband.He started calling paleontologists, museums and universities about the discovery, but nobody returned his calls. He had no luck until he contacted 8 News Now Las Vegas, which helped connect him with Joshua Bonde, a paleontologist with the Nevada Science Center.
