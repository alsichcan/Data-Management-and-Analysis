Joaquin Castro: Impeachment Manager Has Fought Trump on Immigration
WASHINGTON — Representative Joaquin Castro, Democrat of Texas, has made no secret of his desire to see President Trump out of office: He has been one of the most vocal critics of the president’s immigration policies and voted to impeach him the first time.Now Mr. Castro, a Harvard-educated lawyer who sits on the Intelligence Committee, will be a part of the prosecution against Mr. Trump as an impeachment manager in the Senate trial.In his remarks on the House floor on Wednesday before the vote to impeach Mr. Trump, Mr. Castro described the attack on the Capitol and then asked his fellow lawmakers: “What do you think they would have done if they had gotten in? What do you think they would have done to you? And who do you think sent them here?”He concluded that impeachment was the only option.“If inciting a deadly insurrection is not enough to get a president impeached, then what is?” Mr. Castro said. “All of us must answer that question today.”
