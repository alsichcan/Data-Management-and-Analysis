Biden asks Congress about splitting days between impeachment and confirming his nominees and passing his agenda.
President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. said he was exploring ways for Democrats in Congress to advance his agenda while pursuing a second impeachment of President Trump.Asked about the impeachment proceeding now underway against Mr. Trump in Congress, where House Democrats introduced an article of impeachment today, Mr. Biden noted that his top priority is the passage of a new economic stimulus plan and repairing the U.S. economy.But Mr. Biden added that he had spoken to House and Senate Democrats about whether it would be possible to “bifurcate” Congressional business, splitting days between impeachment and confirming his nominees and passing his agenda.“I haven’t gotten an answer from the Parliamentarian yet,” the president-elect said at Christiana Hospital in Newark, Del., where he received a second dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech coronavirus vaccine.
