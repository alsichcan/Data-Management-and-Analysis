Soon to be on the wall in Harris’s Office: A Golden State Warriors Jersey
There will be a distinctly Northern California touch to the office of the vice president. Hanging on the wall, per a promise from Vice President-elect Kamala Harris, will be a jersey from the Golden State Warriors, number 49. On the back: “Madame V.P.” As tributes trickle in for Ms. Harris’s historic, barrier-breaking rise to the executive office, her hometown basketball team posted a tribute video on Wednesday morning that begins with a little girl named Stella in an oversized Madame V.P. jersey.
