At 18, He Had Consensual Gay Sex. Montana Wants Him to Stay a Registered Offender.
In 1993, when he was 18, Randall Menges had consensual sex with two other teenage boys at a camp in Idaho.Mr. Menges was charged by state prosecutors with “crimes against nature” — a charge since ruled unconstitutional that was used to prosecute people who engaged in sodomy or oral sex — and served seven years in prison, according to federal court documents.When he was released, he was placed on the sex-offender registry in Idaho and then in Montana, where he later moved. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Montana ruled that Mr. Menges’s name should be removed from the state’s sex-offender registry.Mr. Menges, who has been rejected from jobs, lost friends and even contemplated suicide because of his status, said he cried when he was told about the decision. One of his lawyers, Elizabeth Ehert, said the ruling would allow him to rebuild a life that “has been utterly destroyed by the homophobic laws that made gay sex illegal.”
