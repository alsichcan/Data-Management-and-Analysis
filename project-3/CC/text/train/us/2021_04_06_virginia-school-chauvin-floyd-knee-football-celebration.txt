School District Investigating ‘Abhorrent’ George Floyd Image Posted by Student
A Virginia school district said it was investigating an image posted on social media by a high school football player that repurposed a photo of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer charged with murdering George Floyd, kneeling on Mr. Floyd’s neck to celebrate his team’s recent victory.The doctored image, which the student posted after his team won a game on Friday, shows the Cave Spring High School logo superimposed onto Mr. Chauvin’s face. The logo of the losing team, Hidden Valley High School, was edited onto Mr. Floyd’s face.In addition to the football player, a “handful of other” students reposted the image on social media, according to Ken Nicely, the superintendent of Roanoke County Public Schools. The district became aware of the image on Saturday evening, after multiple parents and other members of the community reported it to the high school, he said.“At no point was there any question that this was abhorrent,” said Chuck Lionberger, a spokesman for the district. He added that there were other photos posted celebrating the victory that were “not related to George Floyd, but equally as deplorable.”
