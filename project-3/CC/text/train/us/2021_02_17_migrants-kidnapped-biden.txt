Father and Son Abducted in Mexico Are Allowed into the U.S.
A father and son who were kidnapped while waiting in Mexico under a Trump-era policy that barred asylum seekers from entering the United States were allowed into the country on Wednesday. They were among the first to be admitted since the Biden administration announced last week that it would begin letting in some migrant families who had been kept out under the policy.José, 29, crossed the border shortly after sunrise in Brownsville, Texas, with his 4-year-old son, Santiago, asleep in his arms wearing a blue mask.“We just entered. Thank God, we made it,” José said. “I don’t have words to express the joy that I feel now, to be able to join my family.”
