Here are a few takeaways from the final day of Trump’s impeachment trial.
The conclusion of Donald J. Trump’s impeachment trial on Saturday was briefly cast into doubt after a last-minute request for witness testimony threatened to extend the proceedings. But the issue was resolved, paving the way for closing arguments and a vote that delivered Mr. Trump’s second acquittal of high crimes and misdemeanors. Here are some of the takeaways from the fifth and last day of the trial.Democrats needed 17 Republicans to vote with them to convict Mr. Trump of a single charge of “incitement of insurrection” for his role in the Capitol assault. In the end, only seven broke ranks, one more than expected: Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina.In the closing arguments, Mr. Trump’s defense team denounced the deadly violence on Jan. 6 and maintained that the former president was maligned by a biased news media and was the victim of a protracted “vendetta” by his political opponents.Representative Joe Neguse of Colorado, one of the impeachment managers, raised the prospect of more politically motivated attacks in the future should Mr. Trump not be held accountable.
