13,000 School Districts, 13,000 Approaches to Teaching During Covid
What does it mean to go to public school in the United States during the pandemic?The answer looks so different in different parts of the country, it is hard to tell that we are one nation.In some rural and suburban areas, especially in the South, Midwest and Great Plains, almost all students began the 2020-21 academic year attending school in person, and they have continued to do so, except for temporary closures during outbreaks.In many cities, the bulk of students havenâ€™t been in a classroom since March. And in some districts, like New York City, only younger students have the option of going to school in person, with many attending only part-time.
