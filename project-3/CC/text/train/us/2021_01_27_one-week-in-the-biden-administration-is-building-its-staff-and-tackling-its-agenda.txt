One week in, the Biden administration is building its staff and tackling its agenda.
At noon today, President Biden will have been in office for a week, and the split-screen between new and old that has defined the first days of his administration continues.It is an image of a government trying to operate on three tracks at once: enacting a new administration’s agenda, staffing the new administration’s agencies and trying to punish a departed president whose supporters attacked the seat of that government just three weeks ago.On Wednesday, Mr. Biden will deliver remarks about climate change and scientific integrity.But the Senate has had to spend some time focused on the last administration. On Tuesday senators voted to proceed with its impeachment trial of former President Donald J. Trump over the objections of Republicans who had argued that it was unconstitutional to try him after he left office. The 55-to-45 vote was a short-term victory for supporters of impeachment, but it was also a strong indication that they were unlikely to find the 17 Republicans needed to convict Mr. Trump. Several Republicans who voted to uphold the constitutional challenge, which would have effectively killed the trial, rushed after the vote to clarify that they remained open-minded about the trial, which next convenes on Feb. 9.In the same body on the same day, senators confirmed Antony J. Blinken as secretary of state by a vote of 78 to 22 and a committee heard testimony from Gov. Gina M. Raimondo of Rhode Island, Mr. Biden’s nominee for commerce secretary. Vice President Kamala Harris also swore in Janet Yellen as Treasury secretary, and the president’s cabinet is taking shape. Ms. Harris will swear in Mr. Blinken at a ceremony on Wednesday morning.
