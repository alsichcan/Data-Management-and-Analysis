Liberals are getting impatient with Biden’s foreign policy decisions.
Two months into the new administration, President Biden’s base is expressing frustration with his approach to foreign policy issues.Although Mr. Biden delighted liberals with several swift actions — including rejoining the Paris climate accord and withdrawing support for the Saudi-led war in Yemen — he prompted frustration by ordering an airstrike in Syria and declining to punish the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, for the brutal murder of a dissident journalist and American resident, Jamal Khashoggi.On Wednesday, Mr. Biden fueled the discontent when he conceded in an interview with ABC News that it would be “tough” to meet a May 1 deadline, set under former President Donald J. Trump, to withdraw troops from Afghanistan, a high priority for liberals impatient to end what they call “endless” American wars.And more conflict may lie ahead on military spending, with Mr. Biden expected to propose few if any cuts to a Pentagon budget that swelled under Mr. Trump. Fifty House Democrats sent the White House a letter this week calling for a “significant” reduction.
