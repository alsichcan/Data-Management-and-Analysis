One Day’s Pandemic Losses: Among Thousands, a Father, a Child, a Friend
It was 3 a.m. when Latraile Williams was startled from her sleep in her family’s Gainesville, Fla., home with a phone call. The voice on the other end, the doctor, sounded urgent, his words coming in slow bursts. Her husband of 23 years had very little time left. “Dear God,” she began to pray. “Dear God, give me strength.”Ten minutes later, she received a second call. It was too late.Her husband, Stacey Williams, a beloved youth football coach and father of five, had died from complications of Covid-19. All that was left was for her to replay the cellphone video that he had made from his hospital bed.Looking into the camera with tubes in his nose, Mr. Williams tells his wife and children not to stress, that he is a fighter guided by his faith in God. He asks his children to stay positive and strong for their mother. “Keep hanging on,” he says, later adding, “I love y’all.”As the national death toll from the virus nears 400,000, a horrifying milestone, people in the United States have been dying of Covid-19 at the highest rate of the pandemic. The new tally is the equivalent of wiping out a city the size of Oakland, Calif. It is on the order of Sept. 11 deaths more than a hundred times over. At that scale, the human brain compensates with a defense that political psychologists call “psychic numbing.”
