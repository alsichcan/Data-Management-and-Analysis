Behind Biden’s Flip-Flop on Refugees
Back in February, as President Biden signed executive orders reversing a number of Trump-era immigration policies, he pledged “to undo the moral and national shame of the previous administration that literally, not figuratively, ripped children from the arms of their families.”Since then, inconvenient realities have set in. Mr. Biden has been embroiled in a humanitarian emergency, not to mention a political quagmire, dealing with the migration surge at the southern border. And with a comprehensive immigration bill stalled in the Senate, Democrats there are looking for a way to bundle a compromise into another bill that could be passed through budgetary reconciliation.But the Trump administration’s isolationist turn was felt well beyond the border, and human-rights advocates have been watching eagerly to see whether Mr. Biden will fully roll back all the restrictions that he has the power to.So they reacted in outrage last month when the White House said it would temporarily leave in place the previous administration’s 15,000-person annual cap on refugees allowed into the United States — the lowest number in decades.
