Derek Chauvin’s Lawyer Asks for a New Trial After Guilty Verdict
The lawyer for the former Minneapolis police officer convicted of murdering George Floyd filed a motion on Tuesday asking for a new trial on several grounds, including jury misconduct.The lawyer, Eric Nelson, said that his client, Derek Chauvin, did not receive a fair trial for several reasons, including the judge’s decisions to not sequester the jury during the trial, to not change the location of the proceedings and to not grant a new trial because of publicity that included the intimidation of the defense’s expert witnesses. Mr. Nelson also wrote “that the jury committed misconduct, felt threatened or intimidated, felt race-based pressure during the proceedings, and/or failed to adhere to instructions during deliberations.”There were no detailed arguments provided in the motion, which was expected and is a common step following a criminal conviction. It remains to be seen how effective any of the arguments will be because courts have set a high bar for overturning jury verdicts.The motion was filed as one of the jurors came under scrutiny — mostly from conservative commentators online — for a photo from last year that showed him attending the 57th anniversary of the March on Washington, when the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his famous “I Have a Dream” speech.
