Critical questions on security, pardons and politics will be answered in the next 24 hours.
Rain is not in the forecast for President-elect Joseph R. Biden’s inauguration on Wednesday, but uncertainty, sown by his predecessor, will cloud the proceedings.President Trump’s incitement of the Jan. 6 riot, and his refusal to attend Mr. Biden’s swearing-in — if for no other reason than to prove he is tangibly and personally committed to the peaceful transfer of power — have made the topic of security as inescapable as the armed troops marching through the streets of Washington.Mr. Biden’s team and security officials are nervous, but believe they have taken sufficient precautions — and a quick overview of the deployments starkly illustrates the state of high alert.As of Tuesday morning, 25,000 National Guard troops from 50 states and three territories had taken up positions in and around the Capitol, as well as throughout the city, Guard officials said.
