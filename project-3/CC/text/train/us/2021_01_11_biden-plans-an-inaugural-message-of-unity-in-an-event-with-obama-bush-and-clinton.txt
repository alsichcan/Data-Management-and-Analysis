Biden plans an inaugural message of unity, in an event with Obama, Bush and Clinton.
President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. plans to call on a divided nation to come together at a time of political crisis and a deadly pandemic with an “America United” Inauguration Day theme, his inaugural committee announced Monday.He will also pay a visit to Arlington National Cemetery with three previous presidents, who represent both major parties. President Trump announced last week that he would not be attending the Jan. 20 inauguration in Washington.Mr. Biden’s message reflects “the beginning of a new national journey that restores the soul of America, brings the country together and creates a path to a brighter future,” the inaugural committee said in a statement Monday. “Our political divisions are seeking to tear us apart and continue to test the strength of our democracy. The moment calls for sober reflection and the mustering of our national resolve. It is also a moment of hope.”Mr. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris also plan to visit Arlington National Cemetery after his swearing in, where they will lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns, according to the inaugural committee’s statement.
