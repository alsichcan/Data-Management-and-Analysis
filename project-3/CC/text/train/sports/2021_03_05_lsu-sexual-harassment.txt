L.S.U. Says It ‘Betrayed’ Students Who Accused Athletes of Attacks
Louisiana State University, one of the most prominent institutions in the South and a powerhouse of college sports, failed to prevent abuse or harassment by some of its athletes and its onetime football coach or sufficiently investigate accusations against them, according to two reports released this week.Although the coach, Les Miles, was fired more than four years ago for his poor on-field record and was later hired by the University of Kansas, investigators found in a 2013 report that was made public only on Thursday that he had acted improperly toward at least one female student who worked for the L.S.U. athletic department.Then on Friday, hours before Kansas said it had placed Miles on leave, a more sweeping 148-page account documented a long record of errors, missteps and secrecy around misconduct allegations across L.S.U. The report, prepared by a law firm that L.S.U. hired last year after USA Today detailed accusations against former athletes, prompted the university to suspend two athletics executives without pay.“Our job is to protect our students and support them in their times of need,” L.S.U.’s interim president, Thomas C. Galligan Jr., said on Friday. “It has become clear we haven’t always fully lived up to our commitment.”
