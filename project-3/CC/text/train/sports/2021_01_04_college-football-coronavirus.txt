The College Football Champion Not in the Title Game
Who will be college football’s next national champion, Alabama or Ohio State? The correct answer should be neither.The team we should be cheering won’t be on the field at Hard Rock Stadium near Miami next Monday.The real champion?The University of Connecticut, which was the first Football Bowl Subdivision team to squarely face the coronavirus and decide against playing a single snap during a raging pandemic.Given the pain and tumult of the last year, it can be hard to remember there was a time when the powers that rule major college sports were more concerned about the virus than about fattening their bank accounts.
