The Retired Boys of Summer Play On
The Retired Boys of Summer were not going to let a pandemic — or a little rain — interrupt their game.They had already endured a pause in their season, not unlike the ones most professional leagues have faced, because of a player’s positive test for the coronavirus.So when the first official game of the new year arrived on Jan. 4, the roughly 90 players on seven teams of the Golden Years Senior Softball League were ready to go, drizzle be damned.
