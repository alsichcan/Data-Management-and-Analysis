Opponents Beware: Willow Johnson Inherited Her Father’s Left Arm
As the daughter of a Hall of Fame baseball player, Willow Johnson learned at a young age about the sacrifice and commitment needed to compete at the highest level of sports.Her father, the left-handed pitcher Randy Johnson, demonstrated that over a brilliant 22-year career, rarely taking time off from perfecting his craft. But his career rarely asked him to travel farther than Canada.Willow Johnson, an elite volleyball player, didn’t have that luxury. Until recently, there was no pro league for women in the United States, forcing her overseas to find opportunities to play professionally. Last summer, she went to western Turkey to be the right-side hitter for Nilufer Belediyespor in one of the top women’s leagues in the world, where the expectations for players are every bit as demanding as those in professional baseball.It was a culture shock in almost every way, from the language and food to the sheer intensity of the volleyball itself. Just buying groceries could be a challenge. Even though the season did not start until September, Johnson, 22, was required to be in Nilufer in late June to begin a two-month preseason, and most of her time there was consumed by volleyball and more volleyball, all day long, every day. Then she went home alone and repeated the cycle the next day.
