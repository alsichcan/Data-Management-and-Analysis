The Mets Quietly Fired a Second Employee for Sexual Harassment
Jared Porter wasn’t the only employee the Mets fired in January over allegations of sexual harassment. The team revealed a second dismissal on Wednesday after details of the case were published by The Athletic. According to that report, Ryan Ellis, an organizational hitting coordinator, made explicit and threatening overtures to at least three female team employees, who initially told the club’s human resources department about his behavior in 2018.The Mets said in a statement on Wednesday that the case had been investigated at the time and Ellis was placed on probation and sent for counseling, but was allowed to continue in his work with the team. But after Porter, the former general manager, was fired on Jan. 19 for sending lewd texts and photos to a female reporter, “new information” regarding Ellis came to light and he was fired a few days later.“We immediately commenced a new investigation and terminated the employee on January 22 for violating company policy and failure to meet the Mets’ standards for professionalism and personal conduct,” the statement said. “We believe the complaints were investigated properly by our H.R. personnel and in accordance with our reporting procedures at that time.”It is the third sexual harassment case involving Mets employees to come to light this year. After Porter was fired, it was revealed that Mickey Callaway, the former manager of the Mets, was accused of harassing female reporters during his tenure with several teams, including the Mets. Callaway was fired by the Mets after the 2019 season and is currently suspended from his role as the pitching coach of the Los Angeles Angels, pending a full investigation.
