Want the Final Four Court? You Have to Win on It First.
Villanova fans won’t soon forget the buzzer-beating shot by Kris Jenkins that won the 2016 N.C.A.A. men’s basketball championship game in Houston. But if they ever need a little reminder, the college in the Philadelphia suburbs has the exact hardwood — complete with two footprints marking the spot where Jenkins took the shot — on display in a cafe area inside the university’s on-campus arena.Like 10 of the last 11 winners of the men’s tournament, and at least four recent women’s champions, Villanova acquired the Final Four floor (confetti not included) on which it won its title as one of the spoils of its victory.Each spring, the winning team has two weeks to decide to purchase the floor, a portable surface made for the N.C.A.A. specifically for use in only the two national semifinals and the championship game. They don’t often refuse.
