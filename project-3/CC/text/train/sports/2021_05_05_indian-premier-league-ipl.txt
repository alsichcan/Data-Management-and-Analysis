Athletes Stranded After Suspension of the Indian Premier League
The Indian Premier League provides international cricket stars with their most lucrative paydays of the year. The annual event in cricket-mad India draws television viewers from around the world and pays top players as much as $2 million for two months’ work.But the stars who went to India for the games last month during a surge in Covid-19 cases ended up getting more than they bargained for. With the tournament about half over, the league was suspended this week, perhaps permanently, after three players tested positive. A group of Australian stars and other officials is now stranded because of border restrictions, unable to return — at least for the next two weeks — to their country.About 40 Australian players, commentators and staff members will now head to the Maldives or Sri Lanka for 10 days until restrictions on flights from India to Australia lift on May 15. Once they return home, they will have a further two-week quarantine period.Though no Australians were in the first group that tested positive on Tuesday, an Australian coach and one of the country’s top former players, Michael Hussey, tested positive on Wednesday. Hussey was reported to be in good health, but he will remain in India in isolation for 10 days.
