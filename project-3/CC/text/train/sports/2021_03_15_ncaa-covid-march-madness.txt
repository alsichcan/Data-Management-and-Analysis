[See our complete guide to March Madness.]For the N.C.A.A., the easy part — setting a bracket and crowning Baylor, Gonzaga, Illinois and Michigan as the No. 1 seeds for the Division I men’s basketball tournament that will begin this week — ended on Sunday night. Now the association faces a weekslong test of its choice to play its signature event during the coronavirus pandemic.The decision to pull 68 teams from across the country into a tournament in Indiana will have enormous repercussions for college sports. A successful men’s tournament, as well as a smooth women’s tournament in Texas, would lift the morale and finances of an industry that the pandemic has left in a precarious position. The N.C.A.A. lost nearly $56 million in its most recent fiscal year, primarily because the 2020 men’s tournament was not held.If the competitions exacerbate the public health crisis or stumble significantly, college sports leaders, already under scrutiny on Capitol Hill and in the courts, will face scrutiny about whether they had prized money more than safety.
