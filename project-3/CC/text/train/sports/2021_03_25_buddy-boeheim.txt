The Son Shoots, the Father Shouts, and Syracuse Keeps Winning
Juli Boeheim knows some people see her husband as a gruff, nasally-voiced 76-year-old who seemingly has been coaching men’s basketball at Syracuse University since Dr. James Naismith first hung up a peach basket.But she knows a softer side of her husband, especially when it comes to his youngest son, Jackson, who is known as Buddy. Juli recalls Jim and Buddy sitting on the couch watching cartoons or basketball games, Buddy with his blanket and stuffed animals and his hand gently resting somewhere on Jim, often on the top of his head. She fondly remembers the times she and her husband would set up a small basketball hoop for the three children — Buddy, his twin sister, Jamie, and their older brother, Jimmy — and watch as they ran, one by one, into the playroom to dunk the ball.Buddy Boeheim liked to pretend he was Gerry McNamara, the Syracuse assistant coach and former star player known for his long-range shooting, though the toddler pronounced it “Gerwy McDamarwa.”Jim Boeheim has been the head coach at Syracuse since 1976, 23 years before Buddy, 21, was born. Now they are enjoying a storybook phase of their relationship, with father coaching son — who also happens to be Syracuse’s best player — on a run to the round of 16 of the N.C.A.A. men’s tournament. The 11th-seeded Orange will face No. 2 Houston in a regional semifinal on Saturday night at Hinkle Fieldhouse.
