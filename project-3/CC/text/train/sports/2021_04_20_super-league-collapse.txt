Super League Collapses as Premier League Teams Walk Away
Plans for a European soccer superleague collapsed spectacularly on Tuesday as the project’s six Premier League clubs — half of the Super League’s founding members — walked away from the plan only two days after it was announced.Manchester City, one of the six English teams that had signed up as founding members of the new Super League, was the first to confirm it was out, saying in a one-sentence statement that it had begun the process of withdrawing from the project.Within hours, Chelsea, Manchester United, Arsenal, Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool all signaled they, too, would decline to take part.
