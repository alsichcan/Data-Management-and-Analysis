Don Sutton, Hall of Fame Right-Hander, Is Dead at 75

He went on to win 233 games during 16 seasons with the team, the most in franchise history.“When you gave him the ball, you knew one thing,” the former Dodger manager Tommy Lasorda, who died this month, once said. “Your pitcher was going to give you everything he had.”
