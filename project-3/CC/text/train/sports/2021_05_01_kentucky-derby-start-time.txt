Medina Spirit Wins the 147th Kentucky Derby
LOUISVILLE, Ky. — On another first Saturday in May, the beauty of America’s oldest sport battled neck and neck down the stretch with its unseemliness as a colt named Medina Spirit elegantly held off a determined challenge from Mandaloun.They moved in tandem like four-legged ballet dancers — effortlessly, beautifully. No one here who loved thoroughbred racing could catch a breath after Medina Spirit crossed the finish line half a length ahead of Mandaloun and comfortably ahead of the pre-race favorite, Essential Quality.With the colt’s victory, the Hall of Fame trainer Bob Baffert won his seventh Kentucky Derby, surpassing the record set by Ben Jones, who collected his blankets of roses in 1938, 1941, 1944, 1948, 1949 and 1952.
