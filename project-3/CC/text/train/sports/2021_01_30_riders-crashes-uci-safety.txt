How a Horrifying Cycling Crash Set Up a Battle Over Safety
The Dutch cyclist Fabio Jakobsen was battling for the lead near the end of the Stage 1 sprint at the Tour of Poland last summer. A sudden shift in direction by his closest rival, Dylan Groenewegen, forced Jakobsen to swerve, starting a gruesome crash that stunned even observers accustomed to the extreme hazards of the sport.Going close to 50 miles per hour, Jakobsen collided with the roadside barriers, and then ran into a finish-line official. As the barriers scattered they knocked down a half-dozen other riders, with three too injured to start again the next day.Jakobsen was airlifted to a hospital and in an induced coma for two days. His injuries included a brain contusion, a fractured skull, a broken nose and a torn palate. For a few days, Jakobsen said later, he thought he would die.Groenewegen was barred from competition for nine months by the Union Cycliste Internationale, cycling’s governing body, which cited him for “aggressive behavior” — specifically that “he deviated from his line and committed a violation of the U.C.I. Regulations.”
