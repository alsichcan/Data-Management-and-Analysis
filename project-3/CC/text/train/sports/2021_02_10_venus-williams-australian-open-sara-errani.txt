A Stumble, a Scream and Venus Williams Is Out
MELBOURNE, Australia — Venus Williams moved toward the net in pursuit of a short return, a little stiffly because of her liberally taped left knee. Altering her stride when she saw the ball clip the net, she rolled her right ankle. Her anguished cry echoed through Melbourne Park’s John Cain Arena, causing the fans sprinkled throughout the stands to sit up straighter.At that point, Williams, the grande dame of American tennis, trailed by 1-5 and 0-15 in the first set of her second-round match against Sara Errani of Italy.“I didn’t understand what she had in the beginning,” Errani said, adding, “I was scared.”Errani said she pleaded with the chair umpire to do something. “I was telling him to go, please go to her,” she said.Williams, 40, a seven-time Grand Slam singles champion and the oldest woman in this year’s Australian Open, was down. But she was not out.
