For Michigan’s Players, Activism Has Been Season’s Theme
After No. 6 seed Michigan made its first round of 16 in the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament, an emotional reaction by the all-American forward Naz Hillmon offered a window into a season that has been about much more than winning for the team.“I’ve gotten a lot of individual accolades, and they’re always great,” Hillmon said. “But seeing the work that my team has put in throughout the year, and to be finally recognized as a team, is the best accolade that I could ever get.”As Hillmon spoke, she wore a T-shirt with a small circular patch near her left shoulder that read “BLM,” the abbreviation for Black Lives Matter. “In this time, it’s more than just basketball,” Hillmon said. “More than just being teammates, it’s being sisters.”
