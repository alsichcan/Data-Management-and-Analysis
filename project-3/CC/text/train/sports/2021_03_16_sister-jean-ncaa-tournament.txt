Sister Jean Gets Another Loyola N.C.A.A. Run
CHICAGO — For months, as Loyola University-Chicago’s men’s basketball team made an emphatic march toward its first N.C.A.A. tournament berth since 2018, the program’s most famous supporter, Sister Jean Dolores Schmidt, sat mostly sequestered in her downtown apartment, left to rely on modern technology to keep her connected with her beloved Ramblers.Sister Jean, 101, the team chaplain who became a worldwide celebrity during Loyola’s unexpected Final Four run in 2018, watched from afar this season while taking repeated coronavirus tests — 30 in all — as the Ramblers again stated their case as one of the nation’s premier midmajor programs.After the Ramblers secured an N.C.A.A. tournament bid by winning the Missouri Valley Conference tournament, an open question emerged for the nun who was known for writing postgame emails to each player: After a season of seclusion thanks to the coronavirus pandemic, would a vaccinated Sister Jean be allowed to watch Loyola in person as the Ramblers chased a national title?On Tuesday, the university said it had reached a deal to allow Sister Jean to travel to Indianapolis for Loyola’s first-round game on Friday against Georgia Tech. The announcement came after she lobbied to make the trip and compared herself to the old woman in the Gospel of Luke who petitioned a judge to grant her wishes until he eventually conceded, saying, “Let her do what she wants.”
