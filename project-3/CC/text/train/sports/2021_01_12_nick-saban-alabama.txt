After 14 Seasons in a Stadium With Bryant’s Name, Saban Proves His Equal
As a boy growing up in Tuscaloosa, Ala., Walt Maddox stood along Route 82 in 1983 to watch a white hearse pass with the body of Bear Bryant, the revered University of Alabama football coach.Almost 24 years later, Maddox was Tuscaloosa’s mayor when a City Hall meeting about prekindergarten paused so people could crowd a balcony to gawk at the convoy that heralded the arrival of Alabama’s new coach, Nick Saban.“When Coach Saban came,” Maddox said the other day, “I don’t think anyone who was being honest with themselves would say he would replicate Bryant, or that he would exceed Bryant. You couldn’t imagine anyone being able to do that.”But Saban is now at least his equal. With Alabama’s 52-24 victory over Ohio State on Monday night in the College Football Playoff’s title game, Saban has won six national championships as the Crimson Tide coach, just like Bryant. Add Saban’s 2003 title at Louisiana State, which he left after the following season to try his hand in the N.F.L., and no coach in major college football has won more.
