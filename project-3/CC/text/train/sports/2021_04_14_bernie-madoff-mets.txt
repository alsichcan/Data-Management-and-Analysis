Madoff Nearly Ruined the Mets. The Team Has Moved On.
There was a high-flying, if brief, period in Mets history when virtually every available dollar was cycled through investment accounts managed by Bernard L. Madoff. If the team signed a deal for radio rights, the station was asked for much of the money up front and it was handed over to Madoff, who made it multiply, seemingly without fail.If the Mets received a chunk of advertising cash from Pepsi or Budweiser, they would funnel that into the Madoff accounts, too. And when it came time to buy out Bobby Bonilla’s player contract, they created an annuity, invested the immediate savings into a Madoff account, and expected to make millions on the transaction for both parties.“Put it in Bernie,” was how Saul Katz, the former president of the team, used to phrase it to colleagues in an indication of how intertwined the team’s finances were with Madoff, who it was later discovered was running the largest Ponzi scheme in history.
