‘Overlooked My Whole Life’: H.B.C.U. Set Stage for an N.B.A. Career
Robert Covington remembers his college basketball practices. He remembers the two-on-one full-court drills where he was the “one” and had to try to defend two teammates. He remembers the endless games of one on one that more closely approximated cage matches. He remembers breaking curfew to sneak into the gym to work on his shot — and the late-night phone calls to his coaches when campus security caught him.But most of all, Covington remembers feeling driven when he was at Tennessee State.“I felt like I was overlooked my whole life,” he said.Now in his eighth N.B.A. season, Covington starts at forward for the Portland Trail Blazers, who traded for him in November, banking on his ability to defend, plug holes, make jumpers and help bind the team. It has been a process — Covington has struggled with his shooting — but he continues to provide big minutes for a team that hopes to contend. Because of injuries, he has even moonlighted at center.“We ask him to do a lot,” his teammate Carmelo Anthony said. “But he’s built for that.”On Sunday, true to form, Covington will play an understated role in the preamble to the N.B.A. All-Star Game when he takes part in the league’s annual skills challenge.
