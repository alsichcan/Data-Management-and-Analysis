With Indoor Rinks Closed, Players Turn to ‘Speakeasy Hockey’
NORTHVILLE, N.Y. — One by one, the hockey players drove down a dark road in the foothills of the Adirondacks in search of fresh ice on a recent Friday night.The regulars knew where to turn. Nine pairs of skates dangled from a clothesline above the apron of a gravel driveway, marking the private property’s entrance. Lights affixed to trees illuminated a snow-covered lawn. Wood burned in an old barrel.Christian Klueg welcomed the invited guests — players ranging from teenagers to 50-somethings — to his backyard hockey rink. For 27 years, he had built smaller versions. But when he realized indoor rinks in New York would be closed or have restricted hours because of the coronavirus pandemic, he went all-in on upgrades. He drove 172 miles north to the Canadian border in December to purchase a 1987 Olympia ice-resurfacing machine.His playing surface measured 71 feet by 125 feet (an N.H.L. rink is 85 feet by 200 feet), and it was enclosed by boards four feet high that a minor league team once used. Klueg kept the resurfacing machine next to a seven-foot stack of firewood. Only one thing was missing as he grabbed a stick and skated from his house to his dream rink.
