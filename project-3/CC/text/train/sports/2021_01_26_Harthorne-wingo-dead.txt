Harthorne Wingo, 1970s Knick With Much-Chanted Name, Dies at 73
Any discussion of Harthorne Wingo, a popular reserve for the New York Knicks in the 1970s, usually starts with his name. His first name was Harthorne — not Hawthorne, as it was often misspelled.As for his surname, fans would chant it (“Wing-o!, Wing-o!”) at Madison Square Garden to beseech Knicks Coach Red Holzman to put him into the game.His name “belongs in a poem or a song,” the New York Times sports columnist Dave Anderson wrote in 1973. “Or maybe in a museum, as if a Wingo once were a big bird that is now extinct.”Wingo, a high-jumping forward who stood a gangly 6-foot-6, never became a museum exhibit. But the Beastie Boys used his name in their 1989 song “Lay It on Me”: “More updated on the hip-hop lingo (Not so hard, man)/My favorite New York Knick was Harthorne Wingo.”
