Baseball Puts the Regular Back in Regular Season

Sixty games were all we got, not even 10 weeks — fewer games than a pro basketball or hockey schedule, fewer weeks than an N.F.L. season.“Last year was a sprint, and I don’t know if everybody was prepared to sprint, not only on our team but on other teams as well,” said Dusty Baker, the manager of the Houston Astros. “It’s actually more fun playing 162, because then, let’s see who’s the strongest mentally, physically and as a unit.”The new season, which starts on Thursday with all 30 teams in action, offers more than the usual gauzy promises of blue skies, green grass and the warmth of the sun. Actual human fans, at varying capacity levels, will see the return of baseball as usual: a six-month, everyday companion that should give us a new appreciation of the regular in regular season.
