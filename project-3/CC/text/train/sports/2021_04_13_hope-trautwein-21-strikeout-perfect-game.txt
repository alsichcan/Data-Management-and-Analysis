A Softball Pitcher Struck Out Every Batter? She Hadn’t Noticed.
It is the dream of every pitcher. All the opposing batters retired in order. A perfect game.But is a perfect game really perfect? After all, a few players will have gotten at least some bat on the ball, even if it was just a pop-up or a groundout.Hope Trautwein of the University of North Texas softball team did things a little more perfectly on Sunday. In a seven-inning game against the University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff she faced 21 batters and struck all of them out. No one even put a ball in play.And somehow, she didn’t really notice.“I knew it was a perfect game,” she said in an interview on Tuesday. “There’s that thing about you don’t say it’s a perfect game, but I could hear my teammates behind me. They were saying ‘don’t jinx it.’
