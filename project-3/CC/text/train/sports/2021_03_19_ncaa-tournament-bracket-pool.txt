Savoring the Office Bracket Pool in a Work-From-Home World
It’s not just the N.C.A.A. basketball tournaments that are back. So is the joy — and the heartache — of winning or bombing in a bracket pool every March, a shared experience taking on new appreciation in an era of coronavirus lockdowns.It has been two years since the last men’s and women’s basketball tournaments, two years since Americans have had the shared experience of diving into bracket pools with friends, family members and work colleagues. And so this year it seems people are taking them a bit more seriously — or simply relishing the opportunity to agonize over them at all.Ned Garno, 54, a Syracuse fan who has traveled as far as Hawaii to watch the Orange play, remains faithful to the team, even if he did not pick them for a deep run this year. But a bracket is a bracket, and he filled out three this year.“If anything, I think the pause and everyone’s lifestyle has made it so that people are more apt to tune in,” said Garno, a lawyer who grew up near Syracuse in Oswego, N.Y. “We took a pause in a lot of sports and so forth in the last year, so now that the stuff is back and is coming back, I think that makes people even more excited to watch.”
