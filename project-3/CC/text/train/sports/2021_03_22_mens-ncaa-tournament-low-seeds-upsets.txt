As Brackets Get Busted, Low Seeds Enjoy N.C.A.A. Tournament Attention
INDIANAPOLIS — A journey to Hinkle Fieldhouse, with its rich history (and place in celluloid fiction), seems to have inspired some coaches in the N.C.A.A. men’s basketball tournament to reach for their A-list motivational material.Walking into the old, red-brick hangar, where 24 teams have played through the first weekend of this tournament amid the pandemic, the echoes of “Hoosiers” — “Let’s win this for all the small schools that never had a chance to be here” — are a little too rich to resist.At least they were for Oregon State Coach Wayne Tinkle — except that in the excitement of this so far exceedingly unpredictable tournament, with brackets being busted left and right, he forgot to unholster his most stirring message.“I was saving this one and I forgot to use it,” Tinkle said late Sunday night, after the 12th-seeded Beavers scored their second consecutive upset, knocking off No. 4-seeded Oklahoma State. “I said, we may be on Eastern time but the clock hasn’t hit midnight back in Corvallis. I forgot to throw that one at the guys.”
