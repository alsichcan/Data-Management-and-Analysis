A few scrums broke out.In one of the more bizarre episodes, a man in a red T-shirt and shorts climbed a small tree in the city’s South Howard district, known as SoHo, and rocked back and forth as hundreds of people egged him on, a video captured by Juan Carlos Chavez, a reporter for The Tampa Bay Times, showed.The man later appeared to be taken into custody by the police after people in the crowd started shoving one another, a subsequent video by Mr. Chavez showed. At least one police officer appeared to get knocked to the ground.A total of four people were arrested at the official Super Bowl venues, including Raymond James Stadium, in a 24-hour span that began early Sunday morning, according to preliminary statistics released on Monday by the Tampa Police Department.
