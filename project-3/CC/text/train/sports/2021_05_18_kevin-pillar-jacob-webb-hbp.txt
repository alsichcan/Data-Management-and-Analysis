Mets’ Pillar Has Multiple Fractures After Fastball to Face
Kevin Pillar of the Mets was taken to the hospital on Monday night after he was hit in the face by a fastball during a game against the Atlanta Braves. Hours later, Pillar posted on Twitter that he was “doing fine” after what even he acknowledged was a scary incident.Despite Pillar’s positive words, the Mets announced on Tuesday that the outfielder had sustained multiple nasal fractures. He will consult a facial specialist in Atlanta to determine a course of treatment. There was no word on how long he might be sidelined.The incident, reminiscent of one earlier this season in which Bryce Harper of the Philadelphia Phillies also took a pitch to the face, happened in the seventh inning of Monday’s game in the Atlanta suburbs. Pillar was facing Jacob Webb with the bases loaded and was unable to react or move out of the way of a four-seam fastball clocked at 94.5 miles per hour.
