When Iowa Faces UConn, All Eyes Will Be on Freshman Stars
The next chapter in great athlete duels begins on Saturday.Iowa’s Caitlin Clark leads the nation in scoring at 26.8 points per game. Connecticut’s Paige Bueckers — a freshman, like Clark — became one of the most recognizable faces in the sport as she led a young team to a 26-1 season.For all the hype around the two players, though, Clark will have a comparatively low profile when No. 5-seeded Iowa meets No. 1 Connecticut on Saturday in the round of 16 of the N.C.A.A. women’s basketball tournament.The Hawkeyes feel they’ve been overlooked, and they play with a chip on their shoulder. Clark, for example, wasn’t a finalist for the John R. Wooden Award for the best player of the year, even though she was the first freshman to lead the country in scoring since Ohio State’s Kelsey Mitchell in 2014-15. She was on the second team All-America squad.Bueckers was named to the first team. She’s averaging 19.9 points per game, 6 assists, 4.7 rebounds and plays over 35 minutes a game, drawing comparisons to former Huskies greats like Breanna Stewart, Maya Moore and Diana Taurasi.
