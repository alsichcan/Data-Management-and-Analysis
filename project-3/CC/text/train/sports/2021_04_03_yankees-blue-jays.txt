Gary Sanchez Homers Again as Yankees Top Blue Jays
Gary Sanchez joined Elston Howard in 1963 as the only Yankees catchers to homer in each of the first two games of the season and Jay Bruce blooped a two-run single in the seventh for his first hit with his new team in the Yankees’ 5-3 win over the Toronto Blue Jays on Saturday.Two-time Cy Young Award winner Corey Kluber, limited by injuries to one inning in the previous two seasons, pitched around control problems to allow one earned run over four innings in his Yankees debut.Left-hander Lucas Luetge also made his first major league appearance in six years. Chad Green got Rowdy Tellez to swing under a 96 mile-per-hour pitch to strand two on in the eighth and got a four-out save in the absence of Aroldis Chapman, who completed a two-game suspension for throwing near the head of Tampa Bay’s Mike Brousseau last Sept. 1.A sellout crowed of 10,107 — capacity was limited to 20 percent under New York State coronavirus restrictions — was noticeably louder than during Thursday’s 3-2, 10-inning loss. Brett Gardner, a 37-year-old fan favorite, got loud cheers when he replaced Clint Frazier in left field to start the eighth.
