Olympians Enter a Risky New Event: Line Jumping
In the ongoing calculus of how to distribute limited supplies of the coronavirus vaccine, the broad global consensus often starts with a few groups: doctors and nurses, the ill and the aging, frontline workers and teachers.At no point, typically, would elite athletes — a nation’s finest synchronized swimmers and high divers, its fastest sprinters and racewalkers, its top gymnasts and badminton players — factor into the early discussion.And yet, that is precisely the debate happening around the world in the final months before this summer’s Tokyo Olympics. It is not just a question of bioethics: The way individual governments proceed on vaccinations over the next few months could determine whether the Olympics unfold as a cathartic mass celebration of international sports, or a monthlong global superspreader event.In any other year, professional athletes — young, healthy and obviously very fit — would be ushered to the back of the line. This year, though, with the Olympic Games to open in Japan, where rising case counts early this year forced many of the country’s largest cities into a state of emergency last month, the question has become rather more vexing.
