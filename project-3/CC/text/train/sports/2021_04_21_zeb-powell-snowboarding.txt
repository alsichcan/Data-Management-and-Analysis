Zeb Powell Is Looking for the ‘Next Me’
In a sport whose most famous athletes often are white and usually hail from the world’s most impressive mountain ranges, Zeb Powell, a Black Southerner, is one of snowboarding’s fastest rising and most recognizable talents.It is a status that Powell, 21, is hoping to use to inspire a new generation of snowboarders who may not yet see themselves in the sport.“As of now, I’m kind of the face of Black snowboarding, which is crazy to think,” Powell, who was born in North Carolina, said from his home in Vermont, where he spent much of this winter sidelined with a torn meniscus. The injury forced him to miss this year’s X Games, the event at which he won a gold medal in 2020, his rookie season.It was a bummer to miss the competition, Powell said, but he has long known the power of representation on slopes and on screens. As his online influence grows — even outside the winter months — so too does his ability to reach young athletes who do not see themselves in snow sports.
