The Mets Fire Two Real Coaches. No Word on the Fake One.
It’s all fun and games until somebody gets fired.The Mets had a good laugh over the weekend in Philadelphia, when they beat the Phillies twice with some big hits in the late innings. Behind the Zoom screen, Pete Alonso credited an imaginary character named Donnie Stevenson for helping the hitters. Donnie, you see, is an approach coach.“We just made a nice new hire — Donnie,” Alonso said on Saturday night. “He’s nice. He’s a great hitting-approach coach. Donnie’s been great helping the team.”Then Michael Conforto joined in: “He made an appearance today at our hitters’ meeting. He’s all about the approach. He’s a hitting-approach guy. He’s a guy that just gets the boys fired up and ready to go.”The front office had a different approach. After Monday’s 6-5 loss in St. Louis, the Mets fired the team’s real hitting coaches, Chili Davis and Tom Slater. The Mets have averaged 3.30 runs per game, 29th in the majors and ahead of only the pitiful Detroit Tigers. Yet the team insists that results were irrelevant in this case.
