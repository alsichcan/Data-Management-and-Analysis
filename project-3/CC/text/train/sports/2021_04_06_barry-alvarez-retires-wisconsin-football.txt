Wisconsin’s Barry Alvarez Says He Will Retire
Barry Alvarez, the University of Wisconsin’s winningest football coach, will retire from his longtime post as the school’s athletic director at the end of June, he said Tuesday.The announcement by Alvarez, who turned 74 in December, was widely expected around the university and throughout the Big Ten Conference, which he helped shepherd toward an abridged football season during the coronavirus pandemic. His departure will leave Wisconsin without the day-to-day presence of a mainstay over decades, who oversaw enormous growth in the athletic department and rebuilt its football program into a modern powerhouse of the Midwest.“It has been an honor to be a part of Wisconsin athletics and I take great pride in all we have accomplished over the last three decades,” Alvarez said in a statement on Tuesday morning. At a news conference later in the day, Alvarez said, “It was just time.”
