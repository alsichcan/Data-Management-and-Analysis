Yankees and Mets Will Have Fans at Home Openers
When baseball returns to New York City next month, fans will be there to see it. They will just have to keep their distance from one another.In a continuation of New York’s reintroduction of spectators at sporting events, which has already seen the return of basketball fans to Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Thursday that the Yankees and the Mets would be permitted to operate their stadiums at 20 percent of capacity to begin the 2021 baseball season.That will translate to roughly 10,850 fans at Yankee Stadium for their Opening Day game against the Toronto Blue Jays on April 1. The Mets will be allowed to host 8,492 fans at Citi Field for their home opener against the Miami Marlins on April 8.“We need that. That New York tenacity, that New York crowd brings a different vibe to the ballpark,” Marcus Stroman, a starting pitcher for the Mets, said in a video conference with reporters on Thursday. “That’s something every single guy in this clubhouse is looking forward to, getting towards the end of the year and seeing that population in the stands start to increase, because we know that energy we kind of feed off of, and it creates an environment that’s hard to play in for opponents, as well.”
