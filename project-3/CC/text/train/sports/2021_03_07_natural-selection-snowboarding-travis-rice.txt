Top Snowboarders Face a New Challenge: Freestyle in the Backcountry
It was a powder day at Jackson Hole Mountain Resort in Wyoming, and Sage Kotsenburg, the champion in menâ€™s slopestyle at the 2014 Olympics in Sochi, Russia, was riding free. He carved a path through frosted trees to a snow-covered ramp, took off, twirled one and a half times, stuck the landing and kept going.Kotsenburg, 27, was competing in the debut of a snowboarding tour called Natural Selection, founded by a professional snowboarder, Travis Rice, 38. The event in Wyoming was a two-day affair. Other tour stops in March: one last week in the Valhalla Mountains, at a site in Nelson, British Columbia; and one in the Tordrillo Mountains in Alaska. When the events are over, Rice said, the new format will crown the best all-around snowboarders in the world.The format demands the acrobatics of freestyle snowboarding with its ramps and constructed features and enough know-how to navigate backcountry hazards and land big jumps in fresh powder without cartwheeling down the mountain or sinking like a submarine.Rice recruited an intriguing roster of athletes to Jackson Hole, including decorated Olympians and X Games champions like Kotsenburg, Mark McMorris and Jamie Anderson, and free riders like Gigi Ruf of Austria and Robin Van Gyn, a backcountry guide in Canada.
