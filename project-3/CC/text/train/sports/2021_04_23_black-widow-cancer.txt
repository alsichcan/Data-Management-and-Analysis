The Black Widow of Pool Stares Down a New Challenge: Cancer
Jeanette Lee, better known as the Black Widow, spent years dominating pool tables despite degenerative, debilitating pain and became a top-ranked women’s billiards champion.She learned she had scoliosis as a teenager and has undergone numerous procedures for the condition.Every vertebra from her skull to her tailbone is fused.“I don’t know why I felt like there was a race, but I always felt like there was and every minute I was playing pool, I was gaining on the people above me, and every time I was sidelined, I was just losing that edge,” Lee said.In that chase, Lee, 49, became accustomed to brushing aside discomfort, which was as much a part of her life as her nose.
