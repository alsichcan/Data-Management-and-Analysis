‘Thinking of You Today’: The Texts That Helped Me Mourn the Oklahoma State Crash
Sometime around midmorning, the text messages ramp up. They come from the same people on the same day each year, expressing the same tactful blend of compassion and heartbreak. Their arrival is as reliable as the spring harvest in Payne County, Okla.“Thinking of you today.”Rarely do the messages directly mention the occasion they honor. But their existence is a reminder all the same. So I take the first one as a cue to send out my own messages, always to the same group of people.On Jan. 27, 2001, the Oklahoma State men’s basketball team lost at Colorado and was heading home amid a subpar season. The Cowboys were a yearly fixture in the N.C.A.A. tournament and had made the round of 8 the previous season. Eddie Sutton was having a coaching run that would later land him in the Basketball Hall of Fame. Before the 2000-1 campaign, Oklahoma State had renovated its basketball arena to double its capacity. Yet with a 13-7 record, it was clear that this team would struggle just to make it into the tournament again. With that backdrop, the team loaded into three planes for a short flight home from Jefferson County Airport.A few hours later, two of the planes touched down about 650 miles away in Stillwater, Okla.The third did not. It crashed shortly after takeoff in rural Colorado, killing all 10 people aboard. Two players, Daniel Lawson and Nate Fleming, died, along with three basketball staff members, the team’s radio broadcaster, a radio engineer, the pilot, the co-pilot and Will Hancock, the team’s media relations director.
