Bobby Unser, Racing Clan’s Three-Time Indy 500 Winner, Dies at 87
Bobby Unser, a three-time winner of the Indianapolis 500, a record-setter at the Pikes Peak International Hill Climb and a marquee figure in an auto racing family that dates to the 1920s, died on Sunday at his home in Albuquerque, N.M. He was 87.His wife, Lisa Unser, confirmed the death.Bobby, his younger brother Al, and Al Jr., known as Little Al, combined for nine victories in the Indy 500, and Bobby won it in three different decades. He won the points race for the United States Auto Club championship in 1968 and ’74.Unser conquered a fear of heights to capture the Pikes Peak climb a record 13 times, racing against the clock on a gravel road twisting through more than 150 turns with no guardrails overlooking drops of up to 1,000 feet. The previous Pikes Peak record of nine victories had been held by his uncle Louis.While carrying on a family tradition, Bobby and Al Sr. drove for different teams.“It was hard to be family and yet do what we were doing because we kind of rose to stardom together,” Bobby told the Henry Ford Collecting Innovation Today center in Dearborn, Mich., in 2009. But “Al and I didn’t fight,” he said. “We were the closest of friends.”
