College Football Is Back Already. Really.
Post-Presidents’ Day February can be cruel and cold for football fans.National signing day has come and gone. Preseason scrimmages are months away. If it’s like a lot of years, Tom Brady has won another Super Bowl or Alabama has won another national championship. Gridiron doldrums descend.It is different this year: Although the sport’s richest powers crowned Alabama anew only last month, Division I college football is already back. There was a game on Saturday evening, when McNeese State beat Tarleton State, 40-37, and there is a robust slate this weekend. In fact, the schedule calls for college football every weekend until mid-May. Really.The Football Championship Subdivision, a proud if less noticed wing of college football, is beginning its season in earnest this week. And the coming months will settle whether a gamble — that it would be safer to practice and play early in 2021, particularly if F.C.S. leagues and teams could copy health protocols forged inside wealthier and more famous programs — was a masterstroke or just a monthslong delay of chaos.“I’m probably less concerned about converting third-and-medium and have had to take a step back and make sure our processes and procedures are clean,” said Curt Cignetti, the coach at James Madison, which nearly won the F.C.S. title game at the end of the 2019 season. “Our guys enjoy being out at practice, they’re excited about playing and getting started and yet understand that there are challenges ahead.”
