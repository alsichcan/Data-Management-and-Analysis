N.C.A.A. Tournament: Same Courts, Same Game, New Emptiness
INDIANAPOLIS — When the ball was thrown up for Florida and Virginia Tech at just past noon, so began in earnest an N.C.A.A. men’s tournament that is certain to be unique. The squeaks of sneakers, the fierce competitiveness of a survive-and-advance competition and the March Madness-branded basketball court were familiar, but little else was as 16 games in six venues in and around Indianapolis were to be played on Friday.The atmosphere was as extraordinary as the efforts undertaken to put on a 68-team, 19-day tournament during a pandemic that in its nascent stage last March wiped out the N.C.A.A.’s nearly $1 billion cash cow.Vast arenas — like the football stadium where the N.F.L.’s Colts play — or quaint venues like historic Hinkle Fieldhouse or Farmers Coliseum on the Indiana State Fairgrounds were occupied by only a small fraction of their capacity.
