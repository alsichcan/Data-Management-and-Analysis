Arlene Pieper Stine, 90, Dies; First Woman to Finish a Marathon
On Aug. 7, 1959, Arlene Pieper completed the Pikes Peak Marathon, a grueling mountain course in Manitou Springs, Colo., that no other woman had finished in its brief history.She ascended 8,000 feet to the 14,000-foot summit and descended the same way in 9 hours and 16 minutes.“At the finish line, I felt pretty good,” she said in an interview with the Boston public radio station WBUR in 2017. “I’m sure I was a little tired, but I wasn’t completely exhausted. I lost all my toenails a few days later.”Her achievement did not produce a thunderclap in the sports world and stayed something of a secret as women competing on more prominent stages achieved marathon milestones: Roberta Gibb became the first woman to run in and complete the Boston Marathon in 1966, and Joan Benoit won the first women’s Olympic marathon, in Los Angeles, in 1984.
