British Cycling Doctor Ordered Drug in Doping Case, Panel Finds
The former doctor for some of Britain’s most successful cyclists and teams was found guilty on Friday of ordering a banned drug that he knew would be used to enhance a rider’s performance.The ruling, a stunning end to one of the highest-profile doping cases in cycling since Lance Armstrong’s drug scandal almost destroyed the sport’s credibility nearly a decade ago, raised new doubts about the successes, and the methods, of some of the world’s top cyclists of the past decade.The doctor, Richard Freeman, worked for the Tour de France-winning Team Sky and also the British Cycling Federation, which oversees the country’s Olympic program. He was found guilty by Britain’s Medical Practitioners Tribunal Service of ordering testosterone, a steroid, for an unnamed rider in 2011. The tribunal said Freeman did so “knowing or believing” the drug would be used to help a rider or his team win.The tribunal also said Freeman, the lead doctor for Team Sky from 2010 to 2016, had concocted a series of lies to cover up both the drug purchase and its intended use.
