A Superfan Is Ready for the Game, if They’ll Only Let Her In
Rosie Miller, 74, a devoted Dayton fan since the early 1950s, has red sweatshirts and navy slacks ready for the Atlantic 10 Conference men’s basketball tournament, which begins Wednesday. She has worn her basketball earrings all season. Her tree, still up from Christmas, is decorated with lights and ornaments in the Flyers’ red and blue team colors. Her arm is decorated with two vaccinations against the coronavirus.“I’m dressing as if I’m going to the arena,” Miller, a neighborhood preservationist in Dayton, Ohio, laughed in a phone interview last week.Instead, she planned to sit at home in front of the television. For a year, a reporter has followed her story as she has come to represent the agony of sports fans everywhere separated from their teams by the pandemic, which has intervened for a second consecutive college basketball season.The restructured A-10 tournament will stage the preliminary rounds in Richmond, Va., through Saturday, take a hiatus and conclude March 14 in Dayton. Last season, the tournament was halted just after it began, when the Flyers were 29-2, angling for a No. 1 seed in the N.C.A.A. tournament and seeking to reach the Final Four for the first time since 1967.
