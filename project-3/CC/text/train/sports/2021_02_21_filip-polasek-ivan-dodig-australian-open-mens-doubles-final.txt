In His ‘Second Career,’ Filip Polasek Wins His First Grand Slam Title
Playing in his first Grand Slam final 16 years after turning professional, Filip Polasek was ready for the moment, and nearly every ball that came his way.Polasek and his partner, Ivan Dodig, dominated Joe Salisbury and Rajeev Ram, the defending champions, in the Australian Open men’s doubles final on Sunday afternoon, prevailing, 6-3, 6-4, in a match that felt nowhere near as competitive as the score suggested.“That was way too good today,” Salisbury said on the court as he accepted his runner-up plate. “That’s got to be one of the best performances in a final, ever, so congratulations.”Polasek dominated the match with his ability to return serves, hitting six clean return winners in the second set. His strong returning from the right side of the court helped to generate 15 break point opportunities for his pair; though they converted only two of them, they still had a comfortable victory over the Briton Salisbury and the American Ram, who did not earn any break point chances.
