Dino Gaudio, a Longtime College Basketball Coach, Is Accused of Extorting Louisville
Dino Gaudio, who once led the men’s basketball programs at Army and Wake Forest, threatened to expose violations of N.C.A.A. rules at Louisville, where he spent several years as an assistant coach, unless the university paid him more than a year’s worth of salary, federal prosecutors said Tuesday.The United States attorney offered few details of his office’s case in a filing in Federal District Court in Louisville, where Gaudio was charged with a single count of interstate communication with intent to extort. The type of filing signaled that Gaudio will ultimately plead guilty to the charge, which carries a potential prison sentence of up to two years, as part of an agreement with the authorities.Michael A. Bennett, the acting U.S. attorney for the Western District of Kentucky, said in court papers that Gaudio had met with Louisville officials on March 17 and “threatened to report to the media allegations that the University of Louisville men’s basketball program had violated National College Athletic Association rules in its production of recruiting videos for prospective student-athletes and in its use of graduate assistants in practices.”But Gaudio said he would hold off, Bennett wrote, in exchange for 17 months of salary. Within hours, the prosecutor said, Gaudio sent a text message that included one of the videos he asserted violated N.C.A.A. rules.
