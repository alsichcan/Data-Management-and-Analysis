It Doesn’t Take Genius to Understand Basketball. But It Helps.
When James Naismith invented the concept of basketball, the object of which was to throw a ball into peach baskets, the early games had too much roughhousing for his liking. So he scribbled down 13 rules. Among them: The ball may be batted — yes, batted — in any direction, just not with your fist. A player cannot run with the ball. No shouldering, tripping or holding.The rules, which Naismith would find out as the game evolved in the coming decades, were easy to circumvent. This was a game that invited improvisation and spurred creativity. Sometimes this would happen with a sort of cheating — such as the Yale basketball team reportedly inventing dribbling in the 1890s because of the rule about not running with the ball. (They called dribbling a pass to themselves. Brilliant.) Other times, innovation would happen out of desperation, like Julius Erving’s famed behind-the-backboard layup in the 1980 N.B.A. finals.Nick Greene, a writer for Slate, argues in his new book, “How to Watch Basketball Like a Genius,” that the rules Naismith created set the stage for a sport that could be appealing to anyone.It’s why he seeks out magicians to weigh in on whether a crossover dribble constitutes a magic trick. (No, the magicians tell him, but they do concede that there is misdirection at play.) Or why Greene has a marriage counselor discuss what makes LeBron James an effective teammate and Wilt Chamberlain not so much of one. He consults mechanical engineers about how to make free throws. (A fun fact, per Greene’s research: In the history of modern basketball going back to 1960, free-throw accuracy at both the collegiate and professional levels has stayed the same.)
