12 Years 6 Months 25 Days: A Long Journey Back to the Majors
During the Atlanta Braves’ 13-4 loss to the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field on Saturday, infielder Sean Kazmar Jr. entered the game in the fifth inning as a pinch-hitter, saw four pitches and grounded into a double play. The three-minute appearance may not seem like much, but it meant the world to Kazmar and his family. It was Kazmar’s first major league game since Sept. 23, 2008 — a span of 4,589 days.“Definitely everything and then some,” said a beaming Kazmar after the game. “What an amazing feeling.”Kazmar’s story is one of relentlessness and optimism, and, as Braves Manager Brian Snitker said, perhaps befitting of a movie or book. Kazmar first accomplished his dream, at 24, in 2008, getting called up by the Padres to serve as a fill-in for the injured shortstop Khalil Greene. He played in 19 games, starting in 11, and hitting .205.Like any professional baseball player, Kazmar hoped to stay there. But instead, in 2009, he was back in the minors, where the travel and pay are a far cry from the charter planes and millionaires of the big leagues. He spent two seasons with the Padres’ Class AAA team. He was with the Seattle Mariners’ AAA team in 2011, was in the Mets’ system and joined Atlanta’s AAA team in Gwinnett in 2013.
