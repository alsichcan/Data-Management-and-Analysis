A Major Change in the Minors: Baseball Moving the Mound Back
Strikeouts were out of control. Changes in pitching techniques had resulted in batters swinging and missing like never before. To fix the problem, leading minds focused on the center of the diamond. The pitcher would have to move back.The goal: “the restoration of the proper equilibrium between the two great principles of the game — attack and defense. With the pitcher reduced to the ranks, nine men instead of two will play the game.”So said Francis Richter, the editor of the weekly Sporting Life, as quoted by the author Peter Morris in “A Game of Inches,” his book on the innovations that shaped baseball. Richter’s column ran in November 1892, but the words apply almost exactly to the modern game.Major League Baseball believes that the product on the field is in crisis. The league’s declaration on Wednesday confirmed it: Starting in the second half of the season, the independent Atlantic League — in partnership with M.L.B. — will move its mounds back by a foot. This is not like putting a runner on second base in extra innings or making the bases a little bigger. This is fundamental.
