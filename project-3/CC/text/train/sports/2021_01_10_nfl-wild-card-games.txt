Here’s What Happened in Sunday’s N.F.L. Wild-Card Games
The Cleveland Browns hadn’t been to the playoffs in 17 seasons, but it took them just one game to notch their first playoff victory in a quarter century as they held off the rival Pittsburgh Steelers, 48-37.Cleveland won without its coach, Kevin Stefanski, who this week tested positive for the coronavirus along with two assistant coaches and two players. The team had barely practiced during the last two weeks because their facility was closed to prevent the further spread of the virus in the locker room, but are now set to face the top-seeded Chiefs in Kansas City in the divisional round next Sunday.In a moment that would be emblematic of the stunningly lopsided first half, the Browns scored on the game’s first play from scrimmage, 14 seconds into regulation. A high snap sailed over Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger’s head and the ball rolled all the way back to the end zone, where Browns safety Karl Joseph fell on it for a touchdown.
