‘Pink Skies Ahead’ Review: Partying Through Anxiety
A blue-haired ball of manic energy, the 20-year-old Winona (Jessica Barden) has dropped out of school and moved back home with her parents. In a crucial time for finding autonomy, Winona is stunted. She cannot, for the life of her, pass her driving test. Even though she has outgrown her longtime pediatrician (Henry Winkler), Winona still sees him and he tells her she has an anxiety disorder — a label she immediately rejects. She carries on with her life: partying, getting high, gorging on candy and dating. She meets a strait-laced Ph.D. student and things seem to go on track. But as can be expected, her life hurtles toward a crash.“Pink Skies Ahead” is set in 1998, when the writer/director Kelly Oxford would have been about Winona’s age. Oxford’s debut film is semi-autobiographical, adapted from an essay of hers, titled “No Real Danger,” and it mirrors the anxiety she struggled with as a young adult.
