Lana Condor Says Goodbye to ‘To All the Boys’
The first two films in the Netflix trilogy “To All the Boys I’ve Loved Before” pretty much checked every box on the teen rom-com boy-drama bingo card: a boy next door, a boy doomed to be on the losing end of a love triangle and, most important, the boy who helps hatch a fake dating plot that inevitably becomes … not so fake.So when it came time to film the final installment, Lana Condor, who plays Lara Jean, the girl at the center of it all, was just about ready for a change of pace: “It’s called ‘To All the Boys,’” the actress, 23, said in a Zoom interview on Monday. “It’s been about the boys. From Day 1. We get it.”“To All the Boys: Always and Forever,” which begins streaming Friday, sets aside Team Josh and Team John Ambrose and Team Peter in favor of Team Lara Jean, as she finds herself on the brink of some major life decisions with high school graduation approaching. She’s come a long way from the hopeless romantic who wrote down her feelings in sweeping love letters rather than acting on them, a habit that set off the antics of the first film when the letters inadvertently made their way to their recipients.
