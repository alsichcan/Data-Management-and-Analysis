‘The Marijuana Conspiracy’ Review: Grass Fed
You can almost smell the joints littering the screen as “The Marijuana Conspiracy” shuffles aimlessly forward. Set in Canada in 1972, and dramatizing an actual experiment designed to test the effects of cannabis on young women, this agonizingly gauche movie feels like a missed opportunity for a searing ethical investigation.Fearing that Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau is about to decriminalize weed, a disapproving politician (Derek McGrath) — hoping to prove that the drug inspires laziness and general moral turpitude — hires a laid-back sociologist (Gregory Calderone) to run the study. For 98 days, female volunteers will be confined and ruthlessly monitored while inhaling hefty doses of government-sanctioned grass. When not toking, they will be paid to weave macramé belts and wall hangings.
