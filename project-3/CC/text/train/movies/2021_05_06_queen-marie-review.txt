‘Queen Marie’ Review: Border Talks
Romania has delivered some of the most bracing filmmaking of the past 20 years (“The Death of Mr. Lazarescu,” “4 Months, 3 Weeks and 2 Days”), but “Queen Marie” shows that its cinematic output also extends to stiff, exposition-clotted biopics.Directed by the Italian filmmaker Alexis Sweet Cahill, the movie recounts how the country’s queen, Marie (Roxana Lupu), a British-born granddaughter of Queen Victoria, pressed for a greater Romania — incorporating Transylvania, among other regions — during the postwar peace talks in Paris in 1919.
