How Daniel Kaluuya Makes His Characters Come Alive
DANIEL KALUUYA sized up the room. It was the kind of Hollywood meeting room he’d been in countless times before, brightly lit with white walls and framed posters of classic movies. It was summer, 2019, and Kaluuya had driven to the Warner Bros. lot in Burbank, Calif., for a table reading of a movie that hadn’t yet been cleared for production: “Judas and the Black Messiah,” a crime thriller and historical epic about the downfall of Fred Hampton, the rising star of the Black Panther Party who was murdered by police in 1969.Seated next to Kaluuya on one side of a long conference table were his would-be co-stars, Dominique Fishback, Lakeith Stanfield and Jesse Plemons. Clustered across from them were the Warner Bros. big wigs who had the power to give the film the green light: Niija Kuykendall, executive vice president of feature production; Courtenay Valenti, president of production; and Toby Emmerich, head of the studio.Kaluuya, who was playing Hampton, felt petrified. He figured he was only a quarter of the way into preparing for the role, his first in a film based on a historical figure. Word of whatever he did in that room, he knew, would spread throughout the building. What he didn’t know was that the stakes were even more concrete — producers of the movie had arranged for the reading as part of an effort to get $1 million added to its budget. A good reception could convince the studio to write the check.
