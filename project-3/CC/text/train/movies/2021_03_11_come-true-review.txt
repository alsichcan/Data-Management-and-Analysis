‘Come True’ Review: Bad Dreams? A Sleep Lab? What Could Go Wrong?
On “Come True,” the Canadian filmmaker Anthony Scott Burns is billed as the director, screenwriter, cinematographer, editor and lead member of the visual-effects team. Under the pseudonym Pilotpriest, he also shares credit for the synth-driven, ’80s-style score. He acquits himself well on all counts except maybe scripting (he wrote the story with Daniel Weissenberger). Like “Our House” (2018), Burns’s underseen feature debut, “Come True” is superior throwback horror marred mainly by familiarity and, in this case, an ending that feels like a tease.
