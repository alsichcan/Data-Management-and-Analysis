‘Roe v. Wade’ Review: A Physician’s Change of Heart
Directed by Nick Loeb and Cathy Allyn, “Roe v. Wade” tells the story of Dr. Bernard Nathanson, a pioneering abortion provider from the 1960s who later became an anti-abortion campaigner. Loeb has said that the movie doesn’t take sides and tries simply to “lay out the facts” surrounding the titular 1973 Supreme Court ruling.But it doesn’t take long for the film’s agenda to become clear. A confused, sepia-tinted cross between a mafia thriller, a courtroom drama and a saga of prophetic redemption, “Roe v. Wade” paints Nathanson and the abortion rights activist Lawrence Lader (Jamie Kennedy) as the masterminds of a mercenary anti-Catholic conspiracy. They were in cahoots, we’re told, with Hollywood, the news media, Protestant clergy and rabbis, with the latter singled out in a caricaturish scene.
