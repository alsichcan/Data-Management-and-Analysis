‘The Killing of Two Lovers’ Review: What Lies Beneath
Robert Machoian’s “The Killing of Two Lovers” opens like a crime thriller: A frantic man looms over his sleeping wife and her lover with a gun. Spooked by a noise, he runs off, and the camera follows him down an empty road in the Utah town where he lives with his ailing father. But a ticking time bomb of violence looms over this drama of a marriage, marked by his abjection and told in unpredictable long takes.The man, David (Clayne Crawford, in a Casey Affleck sort of role), is temporarily living apart from his wife, Nikki (Sepideh Moafi). They take turns looking after their four kids and, within the bounds of their arrangement, she’s also seeing someone else (Chris Coy). But while Nikki looks to be letting their marriage drift away, David is all in.
