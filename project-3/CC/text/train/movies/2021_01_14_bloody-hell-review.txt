‘Bloody Hell’ Review: An Acrid Thriller Bites Off Too Much
This noxious thriller makes a hero out of Rex (Ben O’Toole), a military veteran who served time after killing a woman in an attempt to halt an armed robbery. After Rex’s release from prison, he hopes to clear his mind with a trip to Finland — but his vacation is cut short when masked assailants attack him in an airport taxi and blast him with sleeping gas.Rex wakes up hanging from a basement ceiling, with one leg sawed off below the knee.He quickly deduces that he’s in a family home, an assumption that’s confirmed when Rex is briefly visited by Alia (Meg Fraser), the possibly sympathetic daughter of the house who has been forced to serve her cannibal brother.
