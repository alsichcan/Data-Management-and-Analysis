Recreating an Archaeological Discovery From the Ground Down
GODALMING, England — Entirely covered by earth, only his face visible, Ralph Fiennes lay patiently in the ground. Simon Stone, the director of the new Netflix drama, “The Dig,” peered at a monitor, then nodded. “Let’s go,” he said. Fiennes shut his eyes, and a waiting crew poured soil over his head, burying him completely. Carey Mulligan dashed forward, panic-stricken, and began to frantically scrabble at the ground.“I wasn’t really acting; that was scary,” she said with a shaky laugh when the scene was over and Fiennes, looking unbothered, was being dusted down and getting ready to do it all over again.It is one of the few overtly dramatic scenes in “The Dig,” the true story of one of the most important archaeological finds of the past century: the discovery, in 1939, of a sixth-century Anglo-Saxon burial ship at Sutton Hoo, a small area along a riverbank in Suffolk, on Britain’s east coast.The land belonged to Edith Pretty (Mulligan), a wealthy but ailing widow with a keen interest in archaeology, who had long been curious about the raised mounds in her fields. The film begins as she hires a laconic local man, Basil Brown (Fiennes) a self-taught excavator, to investigate as World War II looms.
