‘Rose Plays Julie’ Review: An Eerie Thriller With Mirrored Traumas
As far as #MeToo thrillers go, “Rose Plays Julie” stands out for its unpredictability.A quiet veterinary student in Dublin, Rose (Ann Skelly), has recently discovered that she was adopted and that her original name was Julie. She goes to London to find her birth mother, Ellen (Orla Brady), a television actress who wants no reminders of the circumstances surrounding Julie’s birth and no connection with her daughter. Ellen’s baby was born of rape, and she had asked that there be no further contact with Julie after the adoption.“Rose Plays Julie,” written and directed by Christine Molloy and Joe Lawlor, frames its sexual trauma as an intergenerational one. It contemplates the double lives of women through the ideas of outer success and inner anguish, as well as the trope of the naïve girl versus the seductive avenger.
