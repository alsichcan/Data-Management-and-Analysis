Shaka King Goes to Hollywood
Shaka King was feeling depressed. It was his last scheduled day at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival, and the trip hadn’t gone well. King’s directorial debut, a bittersweet comedy about the misadventures of a marijuana-addicted couple called “Newlyweeds,” had been rejected by seemingly every major company in Hollywood. “Newlyweeds” had cost King and his investors six figures, but it eventually sold, to a small Canadian distributor, for just $25,000 — a result that still leaves a bad taste in his mouth. Even the weather seemed to be against King — a nasty snowstorm in Park City, Utah, had grounded his flight home to New York, leaving him stranded in town for a deflating extra night.At his hotel that evening, King happened to run into another first-time filmmaker, Ryan Coogler, whose flight had also been canceled. Coogler’s experience at Sundance was virtually the opposite of King’s — he’d just won the top prize for his feature “Fruitvale Station.” But the two men, among the very few Black directors at the festival, had noticed each other while making the rounds. They decided to meet up for dinner.“You make fast friends with Shaka,” Coogler, who went on to direct “Creed” and “Black Panther,” told me recently. “He’s hilarious and smart and charismatic — you just want to be around him.”
