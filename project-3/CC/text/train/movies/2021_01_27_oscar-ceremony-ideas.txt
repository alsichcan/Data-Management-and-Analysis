How Can the Oscars Be More Entertaining? Here Are Five Ways
With a traditional in-person Oscar ceremony at the Dolby Theater unlikely, we asked a few industry insiders to tell us about the telecast they’d like to see:A comedy writer whose credits include “The Simpsons” and “Late Night With David Letterman” as well as the 2009 Oscars preshow and the 2014 Kennedy Center Honors.To add excitement to the [best-picture category], I propose the Oscars adopt a Miss Universe type of finale. Each best-picture nominee would select one person — let’s assume it’s the directors — to represent that film. And from the stage, the Top 5 would be called up. Let’s use 2020 as an example. The Top 5 might be “Little Women,” “Jojo Rabbit,” “The Irishman,” “1917” and “Parasite.” So you’ve got this nice tableau of Greta Gerwig, Taika Waititi, Martin Scorsese, Sam Mendes and Bong Joon Ho. They would all stand shoulder to shoulder, and Jane Fonda, who was the presenter, would say: “It’s down to these five finalists. Which will be awarded the Oscar for best picture?” Then they start with the fourth runner-up. Maybe it’s “Jojo Rabbit.” Then third is “Little Women,” and then second goes to “The Irishman.” Then you have that beautiful moment when Sam Mendes and Bong Joon Ho take hands and everyone’s heart is pounding. And then they announce that the first runner-up is “1917,” which means “Parasite” is that year’s best-picture winner.In Miss Universe, if for some reason the winner cannot perform her duties, the first runner-up will take over. So maybe we add a clause that if it turns out one of the producers is a rapist, then they lose [the award] and the runner-up gets to be the best-picture winner for that year.
