Regina King: Speaking Truth to Power Through Her Art
“One Night in Miami,” which will arrive on Amazon Prime on Friday, is a fictional account of a real 1964 meeting of four legends. On Feb. 24 of that year, Muhammad Ali, Jim Brown, Sam Cooke and Malcolm X got together several hours after the boxer won his first World Heavyweight Championship. Although in real life they did share ice cream as they do onscreen, in the film’s imagining, they also listened to music and vigorously debated their roles in and the goals of the civil rights movement.Set in Malcolm’s humble room at the Hampton House, a Miami motel that Black guests frequented, the acclaimed drama follows each of these men as they confront life-altering choices in their political consciousness and professional careers:— Malcolm (played by Kingsley Ben-Adir) is on the verge of leaving the Nation of Islam, which he serves as its most charismatic minister and for which he has recruited the 22-year-old Cassius Clay.— Clay (Eli Goree) is planning to announce his affiliation with the Nation of Islam and his name change to Muhammad Ali the next morning.— The All-American athlete Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge) is torn between his desire to make a difference on the big screen as an actor and his football career with the Cleveland Browns.— And asserting his artistic independence, the singer Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr.) has become one of the few Black Americans to own their record label, amassing dozens of Top 40 hits, including, that February, “A Change Is Gonna Come.”
