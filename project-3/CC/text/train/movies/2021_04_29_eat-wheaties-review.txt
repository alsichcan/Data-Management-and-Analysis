‘Eat Wheaties!’ Review: Chasing Ms. Banks
With his debut film, “Eat Wheaties!,” Scott Abramovitch has wrangled the kind of cast that most first-time directors dream of: a who’s-who of TV comedy that includes Tony Hale (“Arrested Development,” “Veep”), Elisha Cuthbert, Lamorne Morris, Sarah Chalke and Alan Tudyk. But what Abramovitch does with such a lineup is an unfortunate, unfunny mess.Hale plays a sad office worker named Sid Straw who, while organizing his University of Pennsylvania class reunion, sets up a Facebook account for the first time and becomes obsessed with getting in touch with his old classmate: the Hollywood star Elizabeth Banks. (Her supposed catchphrase from college, “Eat Wheaties!,” informs the title.)
