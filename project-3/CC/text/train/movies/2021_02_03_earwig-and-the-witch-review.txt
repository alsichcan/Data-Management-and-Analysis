‘Earwig and the Witch’ Review: Domestic Incantations
A strong-willed young heroine, a witch, a talking cat, cute magical minions: “Earwig and the Witch” has many of the familiar qualities of a Studio Ghibli film. And yet Ghibli’s latest, directed by Goro Miyazaki, the son of the famed animator Hayao Miyazaki, uses ingredients from the tried-and-true Ghibli recipe while serving a film that lacks the heart the studio has always brought to its best.A headstrong orphan girl named Earwig gets adopted by a witch named Bella Yaga (Baba’s cousin, perhaps?) and a reclusive demon writer named Mandrake only to serve as the equivalent of a sorcery sous chef, prepping ingredients for spells, doing dishes and mopping floors. Earwig, whose own mother was a witch, is used to being the boss lady; with her perilously arched eyebrows and pigtails perched like devil horns on top of her head, she typically charms and manipulates her way to her goals but is stumped by her new surroundings.
