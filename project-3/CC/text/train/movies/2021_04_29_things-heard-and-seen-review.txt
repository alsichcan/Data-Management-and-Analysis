‘Things Heard & Seen’ Review: Another Real Estate Nightmare
I’ll say this much for “Things Heard & Seen”: it absolutely lives up to its name. If, out of curiosity or inertia, you let your Netflix algorithm have its way for two hours, you will definitely hear and see some things, though you may have trouble afterward remembering just what those things were.The movie, directed by Robert Pulcini and Shari Springer Berman, is based on a novel by Elizabeth Brundage called “All Things Cease to Appear,” which is a more intriguing title, though perhaps not as cinematic. In any case, the person doing most of the seeing and hearing is Catherine Claire (Amanda Seyfried), who has left New York City and moved into an old farmhouse in the Hudson Valley with her husband, George (James Norton), and their young daughter, Franny (Ana Sophia Heger).
