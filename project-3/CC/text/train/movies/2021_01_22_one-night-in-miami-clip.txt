That is Regina King’s belief, and in her feature directing debut, “One Night in Miami” (streaming on Amazon), she extracts meaning from both the use of words and the absence of them.The film takes place in 1964 on the night that Cassius Clay (Eli Goree) becomes heavyweight champion of the world. Afterward, he gathers at a hotel with Malcolm X (Kingsley Ben-Adir), Sam Cooke (Leslie Odom Jr.) and Jim Brown (Aldis Hodge). The celebratory evening leads to passionate debate about, among other things, the ways that famous Black men should contribute to the civil rights movement.
