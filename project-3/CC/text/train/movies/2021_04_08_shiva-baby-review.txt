‘Shiva Baby’ Review: It’s Complicated
“Just try to behave yourself today,” her mother pleads. But alas, larger forces of the universe seem to be working against Danielle (Rachel Sennott), who finds all of the potential land mines in her life exploding simultaneously at the shiva of a family friend in Emma Seligman’s nerve-racking comedy “Shiva Baby.”Danielle is feeling especially aimless; her parents are still paying her bills, and the money she tells them she makes from babysitting is, in fact, contributed by “sugar daddies” (older men who pay her for sexual favors and attention). She’s already rankled by the interrogations of family friends, and the unexpected presence of an ex-girlfriend (Molly Gordon), when her primary benefactor (Danny Deferrari) walks in the door — with his heretofore unmentioned wife (Dianna Agron) and baby in tow.
