Can Anyone Beat Chadwick Boseman for the Best-Actor Oscar?
This year’s Oscar races are both longer than ever and harder to call: Amid the continuing pandemic, the ceremony has been pushed back to April 25 (with films released through Feb. 28 being eligible), and the usual circuit of pomp, parties and pageantry has all but evaporated, leaving a series of buzzless screening links in its wake.Still, there’s at least one top category where I feel comfortable anointing a front-runner: In the crowded best-actor race, Chadwick Boseman has the edge for his exceptional work in “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom.” Handed this prime opportunity to recognize the late superstar, Oscar voters surely won’t fail to seize it.Still, don’t expect a final five that’s simply filled with Boseman and four pushovers. This year, the category could be one to remember, as familiar Oscar faces are vastly outnumbered by up-and-comers looking to score their first nomination.
