‘The Good Traitor’ Review: The Defiant Diplomat
In the first few minutes of “The Good Traitor,” a woman slits her husband’s throat in a sanitarium, and somehow it’s not the movie’s most dramatic event. The man is the Danish ambassador to the United States, Henrik Kauffmann, and Christina Rosendahl’s handsome historical film recounts his renegade campaign to save Denmark after the Nazi invasion in 1940. Based in Washington, D.C., Kauffmann (Ulrich Thomsen) wheels and deals with President Franklin D. Roosevelt (Henry Goodman) and others to secure the support of the U.S., in defiance of the surrendered government back in Copenhagen.Kauffmann’s machinations — granting Roosevelt special access to Greenland, and generally acting like an unofficial leader in exile — were an audacious gamble during wartime chaos. Rosendahl fleshes out a secret history of back-porch diplomacy: Roosevelt was a family friend of Kauffmann’s wife, Charlotte (Denise Gough), allowing the couple to press their cause during nattily costumed garden visits.
