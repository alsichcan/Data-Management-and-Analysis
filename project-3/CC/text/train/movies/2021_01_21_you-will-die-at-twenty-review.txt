‘You Will Die at Twenty’ Review: Death, and Life, on the Nile
A folk tale turns existential in “You Will Die at Twenty,” the rapturous debut feature by the Sudanese filmmaker Amjad Abu Alala. In a sun-dappled village by the Nile, a holy sheikh tells Sakina (Islam Mubarak) that her newborn son, Muzamil, will live only two decades.The prophecy becomes too heavy a cross for their family to bear: Muzamil’s father soon abandons them, admitting softly to Sakina that he isn’t as strong as her. She’s left to raise their son alone, condemned to misery by her unshakable belief. Dressed in all black even while Muzamil is alive, she counts down his days on the walls of their hut. “Has sadness become a habit?” a fellow villager asks her.
