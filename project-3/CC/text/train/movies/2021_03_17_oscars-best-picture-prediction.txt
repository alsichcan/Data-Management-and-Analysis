How Wide Open Is the Best-Picture Oscar Race?
What movie will win the best-picture Oscar, capping the most unusual year Hollywood has ever weathered? Eight films are left standing after Monday’s Oscar nominations, and though “Nomadland” is considered by most pundits to be the front-runner, an atypical awards season isn’t guaranteed to go with the expected winner.We still have over a month until the Oscar ceremony on April 25, and that’s plenty of time for contenders to make their case. Here’s my take on how each of this year’s nominees could still chart a course to best picture.The production-design category usually goes for big, flashy films with extravagant sets, not movies like “The Father,” which is mostly contained to a single apartment. But the fact that the film still showed up in this category — a tribute to the clever way it shoots spaces to indicate the creeping dementia of its title character (Anthony Hopkins) — is a sign that Oscar voters really responded to “The Father” and were looking for places to reward it.I do wonder, though, if the movie can turn any of its six nominations into a win. A posthumous best-actor victory for Chadwick Boseman (“Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom”) will probably keep Hopkins from his second Oscar, and the “Father” co-star Olivia Colman’s very recent win for “The Favourite” (2018) may hinder her chances in the supporting-actress race. In the screenplay, editing and production-design races, other films are favored. For “The Father” to muster any real best-picture heat, it will have to pull off another upset win along the way.
