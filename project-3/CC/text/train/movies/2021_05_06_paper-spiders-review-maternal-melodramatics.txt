‘Paper Spiders’ Review: Maternal Melodramatics
The mother and daughter duo at the center of the family drama “Paper Spiders” are close enough to be casual about the things they fear. Dawn (Lili Taylor) frets about how Melanie (Stefania LaVie Owen) will soon leave home for college, but Melanie brushes off her worries with ease. Melanie breezily spends her days touring campuses and indulging in first high school romances. She trusts her mother to manage empty-nest concerns.But Dawn’s run-of-the-mill anxiety soon explodes when she becomes fixated on the man who lives next door. Dawn is convinced this neighbor is bugging her home, and she rants about imagined attacks with rocks and electromagnetic rays. Melanie knows her mother is spiraling, but despite all their former closeness, she is unsure how to step into the role of caretaker.
