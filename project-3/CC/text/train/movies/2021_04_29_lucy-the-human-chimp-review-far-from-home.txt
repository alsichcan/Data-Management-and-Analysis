‘Lucy, the Human Chimp’ Review: Far From Home
There’s a strange irony in the appalling trajectory of “Lucy the Human Chimp,” a documentary about an experiment that forced a chimp to live as a human, but resulted in requiring a human to live as a chimp.That would be Janis Carter, whose uncontested voice and pained features dominate the screen as she narrates Lucy’s distressing story. As a student in the 1970s, Carter was hired as Lucy’s caretaker by the psychologists Maurice K. Temerlin and his wife, Jane, who had purchased the newborn chimpanzee roughly a decade earlier and raised her as a human in their suburban home.
