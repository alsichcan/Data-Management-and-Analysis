‘The Reunited States’ Review: Hopeful Moments in a Political War
The quelling of political warfare in the United States has to start somewhere. Topical in broad strokes yet frustratingly allergic to particulars, the well-meaning documentary “The Reunited States,” directed by Ben Rekhi and inspired by Mark Gerzon’s early-2016 book, “The Reunited States of America,” profiles people who have made a mission of listening to the other side.David Leaverton, a former Republican strategist, regrets that he contributed to a toxic political climate; with his wife, Erin Leaverton, and children, he embarks on an RV trip to meet strangers and learn about their lives. Susan Bro, who says she didn’t pay attention to politics until her daughter, Heather Heyer, was killed in Charlottesville, Va., in 2017, carries on Heyer’s civil rights message.
