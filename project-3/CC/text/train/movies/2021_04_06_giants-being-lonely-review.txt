‘Giants Being Lonely’ Review: Indie Filmmaking Being Twee
Starting with its title, appropriated from a Carl Sandburg poem, “Giants Being Lonely” aims to capture something precious about adolescence and American beauty. (Unlike in Sandburg, the “Giants” in question are a high school baseball team.) But nothing concrete emerges from this haze of oblique editing and barely written scenes, acted by cast members who are not up to making the dialogue sound convincing or filling the voids left in place of their characters.In his feature writing-directing debut, the mixed-media artist Grear Patterson mines a vein of twee indie lyricism that recalls the early films of David Gordon Green (“George Washington”) and a hint of the prurience of another art-world figure turned filmmaker, Larry Clark (“Kids”). The movie is set in a Southern town where inhibitions run low. It’s the sort of place where a teenager casually climbs up onto a rusty pipe bridge, strips naked and jumps into the stream below, in front of his peers.
