Hollywood Might Not Want to Save the Golden Globes
The party’s over for the Golden Globes, at least for now.Long marketed as the less uptight cousin of the Academy Awards, the Globes are now scrambling to clean up their act after NBC announced it would not broadcast the show in 2022 because of a series of controversies involving the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the voting group behind the ceremony.To name all of those controversies might prove as lengthy as the awards show itself, but here’s a notable sampling: The Los Angeles Times and this paper both published recent exposés about the group’s double-dealing, a follow-up story by The Los Angeles Times revealed that the group had no Black members, and a late, reluctant set of reforms proposed by the group failed to satisfy Time’s Up and prompted studios like Netflix, Amazon and Warner Bros. to issue statements amounting to an effective boycott.As that scrutiny intensified, members of the insular 86-person association continued to commit new, headline-making gaffes. One member confused Daniel Kaluuya for another Black actor, Leslie Odom Jr., just minutes after Kaluuya’s Oscar win, while a former Hollywood Foreign Press president was expelled from the group in April after forwarding a right-wing article to members that called Black Lives Matter a “hate movement.”This sort of insensitive behavior has been tolerated by Hollywood for decades because the Golden Globes offer the most high-profile pit stop on the way to the Oscars: If you’re willing to schmooze and take selfies with eccentric voters (as well as turn a blind eye to their more questionable behavior), then the group might bestow you with the momentum needed to make it all the way through awards season.
