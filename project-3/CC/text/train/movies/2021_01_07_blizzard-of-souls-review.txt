‘Blizzard of Souls’ Review: A Soldier’s Tale From the Front
This World War I story opens on a striking tableau, one that illustrates its title. A traveling shot takes in a battlefield where a coating of snow almost, but not quite, camouflages the corpses of dozens of dead soldiers.That is about as harrowing as this movie, directed by Dzintars Dreibergs from a 1934 novel by Aleksandrs Grins, gets. As so many war pictures do, “Blizzard of Souls” tells the story of a young man, Arturs Vanag (the fresh-faced Oto Brantevics). At the movie’s outset, he’s a sweet teen on a farm. Then one afternoon, some German soldiers happen by and kill his mother and the family dog. So he signs on with the Latvian battalion of the Imperial Russian Army, along with his father and brother.
