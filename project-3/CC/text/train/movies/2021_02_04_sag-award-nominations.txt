SAG Award Nominations: ‘Minari’ Comes on Strong, ‘Hillbilly Elegy’ Revived
Looking for a little clarity in a messed-up, pandemic-elongated awards season? Nominees for the Screen Actors Guild Awards were announced Thursday, and these prizes, handed out by the Hollywood actors’ guild SAG-Aftra, may provide the best look yet at the contenders with the strongest shots at making the Oscars’ final five.Unlike the weird and wacky Golden Globes, which are voted on by a small group of eccentric foreign journalists, the actors’ guild is more comparable to the academy in its size and membership. Over the last three years, every SAG winner has gone on to win the Oscar, too, so when it comes to awards-season bellwethers, few shows ring louder and truer. (Sorry to Sia’s Golden Globe nominee “Music”: That means your 24-hour reign of confusion has come to a close.)This year’s SAG lineup brings excellent tidings for “Minari,” a Korean-American family drama that missed major recognition at precursors like the Globes and the Gotham Awards. SAG gave the film three big nominations, recognizing the film’s ensemble cast as well as lead actor, Steven Yeun, and supporting actress Youn Yuh-jung.Another film that saw its fortunes rise was the critically derided “Hillbilly Elegy”: Though the Ron Howard-directed drama failed to make the best-cast category, Amy Adams and Glenn Close scored individual nominations over strong competition.
