Golden Globes 2021: A Full List of Nominees
[Follow live coverage of the Golden Globes, and the full list of winners.]The 78th Golden Globe Awards are scheduled for Feb. 28 and will be shown on NBC. Amy Poehler and Tina Fey will return to host the ceremony, which they last led in 2015.The Golden Globes typically take place in January. The Hollywood Foreign Press Association, which gives out the awards, pushed the ceremony to February this year, citing the coronavirus pandemic.Streaming services, including Netflix and Amazon, dominated the list of nominees, both with their own films — like “Ma Rainey’s Black Bottom” and “One Night in Miami,” which wouldn’t have relied on open movie theaters to find eyeballs even during a standard year — and with movies that the streaming companies purchased from traditional studios, including Aaron Sorkin’s “The Trial of the Chicago 7.” The streaming services also did well in the television categories: Netflix hits like “The Queen’s Gambit” undoubtedly benefited from having a captive audience over the past year.
