‘Boss Level’ Review: Game Never Over
Frank Grillo’s character in “Boss Level” is named Roy Pulver, which must be short for Pulverize because that’s what he does to the assassins out to destroy him. No matter what they try — machete, grenade, Chinese sword, the tight-end Rob Gronkowski machine-gunning from a helicopter — Roy has a parade. Up until he doesn’t and gets killed, only to wake up back in his bed, ready to repeat the exact same ordeal and die another day.Directed by the B-movie expert Joe Carnahan (“The Grey), the lighthearted “Boss Level” is the latest iteration of the popular time-loop scenario, spelling out the video-game concept — repeat an action until you get good enough to move on — that has always fed this subgenre.
