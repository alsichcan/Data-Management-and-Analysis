NBC Says It Will Not Air the Golden Globes in 2022
NBCUniversal announced Monday that it would not broadcast the 2022 Golden Globes, an abrupt blow to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, the organization that puts on the film and television awards show. The association relies on the money the network pays for the rights to broadcast the ceremony, and NBC’s move throws the future of the show into doubt.The group of roughly 86 journalists came under intense scrutiny as news investigations uncovered, among other things, its lack of diversity and its system of compensating members for their work on committees.Last week the association approved changes that included increasing its membership by 50 percent over the next year and a half and hiring diversity consultants.But NBCUniversal said in a statement: “We continue to believe that the H.F.P.A. is committed to meaningful reform. However, change of this magnitude takes time and work, and we feel strongly that the H.F.P.A. needs time to do it right. As such, NBC will not air the 2022 Golden Globes. Assuming the organization executes on its plan, we are hopeful we will be in a position to air the show in January 2023.”
