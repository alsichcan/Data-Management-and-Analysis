Here’s What We Would Nominate for Best Picture
Just like you, film critics, reporters and editors at The New York Times have opinions about the Oscars and what should be nominated. This year, a few of us are sharing our wish lists for best picture. (Except for the featured pick, the slates are in alphabetical order, with 10 or fewer entries, as in the official nominations.) If only we could really vote.The word “epic” when applied to movies usually suggests sweep and grandeur, world-shaking events and a cast of thousands. But for Ezra Pound, an epic was “a poem containing history,” and by that standard Kelly Reichardt’s quietly ambitious, mischievously profound film surely qualifies. It’s a quiet, lyrical story of friendship and enterprise, set in the Oregon Territory before the Civil War, with John Magaro and Orion Lee as tender comrades and unlikely business partners. But the history is there if you pay attention — the grand, terrible story of global capitalism and territorial conquest. The cow is pretty awesome, too.
