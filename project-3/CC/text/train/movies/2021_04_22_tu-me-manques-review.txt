‘Tu Me Manques’ Review: Traces of a Lost Love
The Bolivian film “Tu Me Manques” begins with a fight for an absent man’s affection. Jorge (Oscar Martínez) was the father of Gabriel, the former lover of Sebastian (Fernando Barbosa). When a chance phone call makes it possible for Jorge and Sebastian to meet, Sebastian is quick to hurl accusations at Jorge, who wouldn’t accept his son’s sexuality. Jorge has only tragedy to fling back: Gabriel died by suicide upon returning from New York City to Bolivia.
