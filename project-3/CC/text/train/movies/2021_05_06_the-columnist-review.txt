‘The Columnist’ Review: Confessions of a Female Troll Hunter
A writer is thrown into the cyber snake pit when her op-ed criticizing Black Pete — a traditional Dutch Christmas character who typically appears in blackface — is published. Suddenly, swarms of disinhibited men inundate her Twitter account with death threats and misogynist nastiness. Oh, to be a woman online.In “The Columnist,” a glossy and intentionally ridiculous psycho-thriller, the writer, Femke Boot (Katja Herbers), refuses to let the haters bring her down. She makes sure of that by becoming a literal troll hunter who spends her evenings stylishly executing unkempt dudes.The director Ivo van Aart gets to the carnage quickly. Femke tips a neighbor off his roof when she discovers his toxic online presence, then slices off one of his fingers — the first in her soon abundant collection.
