Are Animated Dads Getting Hotter? An Investigation
I thought the whole man-bun thing was played out, and then along came Benja.First, I sparked to his voice, which is warm, soothing and capable of delivering large amounts of exposition in a single breath. Then there’s his face: high cheekbones, strong eyebrows, no pores. And would you look at the way he dotes on his daughter, Raya? Come on, the guy’s a catch.With all of those things going for him, Benja quickly leapt to the top of my long list of quarantine crushes. Still, whenever I tried to imagine some sort of future for us, I kept getting distracted by two glaring red flags: One is that evil spirits just turned Benja to stone, and the other is that he’s animated. (At least the first one is reversible.)Though many would find the whole pixel-person thing to be a deal breaker, I continued to pine for Chief Benja of the Heart tribe (the Heart tribe!) while watching Disney’s latest computer-animated film, “Raya and the Last Dragon.” Then, as the closing credits rolled, I took to Twitter, where I found plenty of other professionals who were proud to let their freak flag fly.“The protagonist’s dad in ‘Raya and the Last Dragon’ is smoking hot,” tweeted the Hollywood Reporter film critic David Rooney, who also noted, “Gotta love thirst-trap animation.” The writer Hanna Ines Flint concurred: “The man’s arms, I wanna hang off them,” she tweeted.
