A Director Returns to the Home He Longed to Leave
In 2018, around a decade after his first feature, the Rwandan drama “Munyurangabo,” opened to rave reviews at Cannes, Lee Isaac Chung was this close to ditching the capricious life of an indie filmmaker for the presumably more comfortable life of a film professor. “I was hitting 40, and I realized I needed to just move on in life and do something practical,” he said.Chung had already taken a position teaching screenwriting at the University of Utah’s South Korean campus in Incheon, but he felt he had one last screenplay in him. “I tried to put everything I could into that script,” he said.That supposedly final hurrah became “Minari,” a coming-of-age story inspired by Chung’s experiences growing up the son of Korean-American immigrants in rural Arkansas during the 1980s. In the film, Steven Yeun (“The Walking Dead”) and the South Korean actress Yeri Han play an immigrant couple who, like Chung’s own parents, moved to Arkansas to pursue the husband’s starry-eyed dream of running his own vegetable farm; irrigation issues, marital strife and Grandma, newly arrived from Korea, soon follow.After making movies in Rwanda, North Carolina and New York City, Chung may have achieved his biggest success to date by returning to the single-wide mobile home of his youth (14 feet across in the movie). “We used to dream about the double-wide,” he said.
