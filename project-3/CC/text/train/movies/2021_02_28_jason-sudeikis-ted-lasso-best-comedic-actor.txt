Jason Sudeikis wins best comedic actor for ‘Ted Lasso.’
The TV categories are something of an afterthought at the Globes, which draws its power from proximity to the Oscars. The foreign press association has tried to rectify the imbalance in recent years by rallying behind shows that have yet to pop. Globe voters, for instance, helped “Brooklyn Nine-Nine” and “Transparent” gain wider attention. (On the other hand, the less said about their early support for “Mozart in the Jungle,” the better.)But the H.F.P.A didn’t stick to its forward-thinking mantra this year and instead chose the Emmy winner “Schitt’s Creek” for best comedy. Globe voters did give a boost to “Ted Lasso,” a freshman Apple TV+ sitcom. Jason Sudeikis, who stars in the series as a sweet and befuddled soccer coach, received the Globe for best actor in a comedy.
