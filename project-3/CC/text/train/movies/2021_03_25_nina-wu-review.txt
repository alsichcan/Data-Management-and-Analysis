‘Nina Wu’ Review: Destruction of Body and Soul
It’s easy enough to slap the #MeToo label on “Nina Wu” and call it a day. Yes, its titular heroine (a remarkable Wu Ke-Xi, also a co-writer) is an actress brutalized and exploited by a misogynist film industry, and the Taiwanese director, Midi Z, never pulls his punches. Yet this startlingly evocative, complex and confrontational new film is not interested in justice or didacticism.An internet-famous livestreamer living alone in Taipei, Nina lands the lead role in a racy period thriller that will ultimately catapult her career. She warily consents to full-frontal nudity (she is constantly reminded that a true professional wouldn’t mind), and on set she is violently abused by a “mad genius” director hoping to draw out the most realistic performance by any means.
