‘Cliff Walkers’ Review: Double Crosses and Double Agents
“Cliff Walkers,” the new picture from the protean Chinese director Zhang Yimou, arrives here after a hiccup in his filmography.“One Second” (2019), the follow-up to his startling film “Shadow,” released in the United States the same year, had been slated to compete in the 2019 Berlin International Film Festival but was withdrawn by the Chinese government in what many interpreted as an act of censorship.It’s likely that “Cliff Walkers,” which is dedicated to “All the heroes of the revolution,” passed through official channels unimpeded. This spy thriller takes place in the early 1930s, during the Japanese invasion and occupation of Manchuria and northern China, and depicts near-superheroics on the part of its daring, sometimes self-sacrificing main characters.
