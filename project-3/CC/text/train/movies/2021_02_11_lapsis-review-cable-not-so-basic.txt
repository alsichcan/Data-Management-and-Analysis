‘Lapsis’ Review: Cable Not So Basic
“Lapsis” is set in an alternate present, but it doesn’t feel that way. A low-budget dig at corporate rapaciousness and the gig economy, this gently comic satire feels entirely in step with the world outside our front doors.Keeping the tone light and the speechifying to a minimum, the writer and director, Noah Hutton, introduces us to Ray (Dean Imperial), a good-humored airline employee. Ray’s modest salary won’t pay for the expensive clinic that could cure his brother’s chronic-fatigue-related illness, so he reluctantly takes a job with a mysterious new cable company. Soon, though, he learns that the necessary permit he obtained from a shady friend (James McDaniel) — and will pay for with a chunk of his earnings — might have had a previous, problematic owner.
