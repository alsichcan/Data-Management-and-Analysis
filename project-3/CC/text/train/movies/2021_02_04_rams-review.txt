‘Rams’ Review: Ailing Sheep and Quirky Characters
The rough, dirty life of Australian sheep farmers would seem an unlikely topic to yield much in the way of cinematic lyricism. Especially in a narrative involving sheep actually dying of a devastating disease. Nevertheless, “Rams,” rooted in a 2016 Icelandic movie of the same name, has its pastoral moments (mostly in its breathtaking views of Western Australian landscapes), not to mention raucous comedy.The screenwriter Jules Duncan’s narrative, given a hemispheric switch from the Grimur Hákonarson original, is not generically unfamiliar. It’s a story of brothers at odds who are forced, after much resistance, to become brothers in arms.Colin (Sam Neill), a taciturn type, shares land but not much else with his older brother, Les (Michael Caton), an angry type who’s more voluble than Colin only in that he likes to cuss people out. They live and work on two adjacent plots, which were once owned as one by their father. Their rams are of a special breed and, as a contest at the movie’s opening attests, are invariably the envy of the region.
