‘Georgetown’ Review: It’s Not a Lie if You Believe It
Christoph Waltz is a magnificent actor, and in “Georgetown,” as in everything, he is a pleasure to watch. As Ulrich Mott, a smooth-talking, uxorious grifter and social climber who wheedles his way into Washington society with the aid of his well-connected nonagenarian wife, Waltz flamboyantly charms and flatters, wearing a wolfish smile as he lies through his teeth.Mott is based on Albrecht Muth, the famous liar and cheat who was convicted of the 2011 murder of his wife, and Waltz plays him as an oily, hot-tempered sociopath on a direct path from fibbing to frenzy. He makes you understand how a man who could so easily lie might, in the right circumstances, just as easily kill.
