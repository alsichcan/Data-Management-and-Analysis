‘Mafia Inc’ Review: The Business They Have Chosen
“Mafia Inc” was officially inspired by a nonfiction book on the Canadian mob. The movie and its characters are fiction, though, and their unofficial inspiration appears to be other mob films. It takes brass to poach on turf decisively owned by “The Godfather” and “Goodfellas,” and the director, Daniel Grou, who goes by Podz, deserves credit for delivering a saga that’s never dull despite hitting overfamiliar beats.Sergio Castellitto plays Frank Paternò, a Montreal crime boss whose latest venture — a share in a bridge that will connect Calabria to Sicily — could make him legit. Frank has two sons: Giaco (Donny Falsetti), who has shades of Sonny Corleone (he disagrees with his father in front of associates), and Patrizio (Michael Ricci), who is engaged to Sofie (Mylène Mackay), the daughter of the family’s wary longtime tailor (Gilbert Sicotte).
