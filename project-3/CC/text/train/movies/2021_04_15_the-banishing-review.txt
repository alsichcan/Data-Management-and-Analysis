‘The Banishing’ Review: Choosing My Religion
Silliness trumps scares in Christopher Smith’s “The Banishing,” a bewildering haunted-house tale larded with Nazis, mad monks, fallen women and a tango-dancing occultist. Why no one thought to include a zombie or two is anyone’s guess.The house in question is a sprawling rectory in rural England, the year is 1938 and a young reverend, Linus (John Heffernan), has arrived to replace the cleric who disappeared with his family some years earlier. Accompanying Linus is his new bride, Marianne (Jessica Brown Findlay), and her out-of-wedlock daughter, Adelaide (Anya McKenna-Bruce). Linus might have generously saved Marianne from societal scorn, but he has no intention of falling prey to her lustful wiles, frantically thumbing his Bible for passages that fortify his resolve.
