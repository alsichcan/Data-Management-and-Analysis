‘Little Fish’ Review: Do You Remember Love?
Chad Hartigan’s “Little Fish” is set amid a pandemic. Not the one we’re currently living through, but one that raises many more existential questions. Instead of Covid-19, the film’s fictional world is suffering from NIA (neuroinflammatory affliction), which causes a mysterious, mass memory loss.Hartigan (“Morris From America”) and the screenwriter Mattson Tomlin tell the story of a newlywed couple, Emma (Olivia Cooke) and Jude (Jack O’Connell), while jumping timelines before and after NIA, including their engagement in the fish section of a pet store. The film may be shortsighted about the global scope of this disease, but the microcosmic focus allows for a much more emotionally devastating film.
