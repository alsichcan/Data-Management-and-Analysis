‘The United States vs. Billie Holiday’ Review: Singing for Her Life
Every great musician is one of a kind, but the biographies of great musicians — or more precisely their biopics — end up looking pretty much alike. Childhood trauma is followed by success and its consequences, usually including addiction and love trouble. A chronicle of artistic triumph doubles as a cautionary tale, with ruin and redemption wrapped around each other like twin strands of narrative DNA. If all else fails, the soundtrack music offers occasional reminders of why we should care.“The United States vs. Billie Holiday,” directed by Lee Daniels from a script by the playwright Suzan-Lori Parks, follows the standard template, with a few new elements added to the mix. Concentrating on the last dozen years of Holiday’s life — she was 44 when she died, of liver disease, in 1959 — the movie flashes back to her grim childhood and expands to include many facets of her life and personality.
