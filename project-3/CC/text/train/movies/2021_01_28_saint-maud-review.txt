‘Saint Maud’ Review: A Passion for Sinners
Folding sexual arousal and religious ecstasy into a single, gasping sensation, “Saint Maud,” the feature debut of the director Rose Glass, burrows into the mind of a lonely young woman and finds psycho-horror gold.Maud (a mesmerizing Morfydd Clark) is a live-in palliative care nurse in an unnamed British seaside town. A recent religious convert — we don’t know why, but the film’s unnervingly gory opening more than hints at a profound trauma — Maud believes that God has chosen her to guide the fallen to salvation. This mission leads her to the forbidding hilltop mansion of Amanda (Jennifer Ehle), a celebrated dancer and choreographer now stricken by late-stage lymphoma.The ensuing interplay between caregiver and patient, faith and denial, asceticism and intemperance, veers from chilling to morbidly comic. Determined to enjoy her final few weeks, Amanda submits to Maud’s prayers while remaining an enthusiastic hedonist. Smoking and drinking with relish, hosting gatherings of her bohemian friends and romancing a younger lover (Lily Frazer), Amanda nevertheless finds comfort in the intimacy of Maud’s quiet ministrations. Still, Maud is a mystery (for one thing, as we learn late in the film, her name isn’t really Maud), but whether she is a batty Bible-thumper or something infinitely more sinister, we have barely 84 minutes to find out.
