‘Keep an Eye Out’ Review: A Crime Procedural That Goes Off the Rails
A man finds a dead body outside his apartment and reports it to the police. What should be, in any other circumstance, probably a lot of boring paperwork, turns into a twisty, farcical procedural once it breaks the facade of banality. The first clue that the story will go completely off the rails is that it was directed by Quentin Dupieux, the French electronic musician (Mr. Oizo) turned absurdist filmmaker (“Rubber,” “Deerskin”). The second clue? Well, maybe the fact that the movie begins with an event — the arrest of a nearly nude orchestra conductor — that has nothing to do with the rest of the story.“Keep an Eye Out” mostly takes place inside an outdated-looking police station with a yellowed atmosphere, overhead lighting and beige furniture. There, the man, whose name is Fugain (Grégoire Ludig), is relaying the discovery of the corpse to the self-serious but incompetent Chief Inspector Buron (Benoît Poelvoorde) — a huge mistake, as his narrative draws the finger-pointing his way, making him the prime murder suspect.
