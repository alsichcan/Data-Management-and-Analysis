Better Call an Ambulance: Bob Odenkirk Is Out for Revenge in ‘Nobody’
On “Better Call Saul,” Bob Odenkirk has walked a careful line between wry comedy and soul-baring drama. Over five seasons, he has played the unscrupulous lawyer Jimmy McGill on his downward path to becoming the venal Saul Goodman, the character he introduced on “Breaking Bad.”The role is a professional plot twist that continues to delight Odenkirk as well as his longtime fans who first got to know him as a writer and performer of absurdist comedy sketches on “Saturday Night Live,” “The Ben Stiller Show” and “Mr. Show With Bob and David.”Now the 58-year-old actor is looking to make another change in his trajectory, one that’s equally, if not more, surprising: starring in the action thriller “Nobody.”The film, which Universal will release on Friday in theaters and April 16 on-demand, casts Odenkirk as Hutch Mansell, a seemingly nondescript suburban husband and father who is shaken by a break-in at his home, an incident that drives him to violent revenge and a reckoning with his own past.
