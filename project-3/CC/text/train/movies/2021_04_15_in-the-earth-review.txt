‘In the Earth’ Review: Grassroots Horror
Movies evolve, and one day it will be possible to look at “In the Earth” and not see the contingencies of pandemic filmmaking. The director, Ben Wheatley, started writing it at the beginning of the lockdown in Britain, and elements of the finished product — the outdoor setting; references to quarantine, a third wave and a disease ravaging a city; the actors’ surgical masks at the beginning — bear unavoidable hallmarks of the past year.Viewed now, the film’s resourceful, even ingenious solutions to problems double as distractions; as those diminish, some of what is potent about the movie may also subside. What will be left is a back-to-basics effort from Wheatley, who has lately dabbled in splashy literary adaptations (J.G. Ballard in “High-Rise,” Daphne du Maurier in last year’s remake of “Rebecca”) but earned his cult reputation straddling horror and dark comedy in lower-budget fare like “Kill List” and “A Field in England.”Now the setting is a forest in England. “In the Earth” trails Alma (Ellora Torchia) and Martin (Joel Fry) on a mission to meet up with Dr. Olivia Wendle (Hayley Squires), who is about a two-day walk deep into the woods. Her communications have stopped, and we’ve been told that “people get a bit funny” out there. Dr. Wendle’s research — involving trees connected and controlled in a network that behaves like a brain — sounds more than a tad peculiar.
