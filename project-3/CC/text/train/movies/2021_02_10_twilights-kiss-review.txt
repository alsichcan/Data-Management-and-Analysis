‘Twilight’s Kiss’ Review: A Hidden Romance, Late in Life
Pak, a 70-year-old Hong Kong taxi driver, fits cruising into his daily routine, away from the eyes of his suspicious wife. Then at a park he meets Hoi, a twinkly-eyed retiree with a dapper mustache, and the two nurture a deeper, tender connection that’s at the heart of “Twilight’s Kiss,” a look at love that comes late and is burdened by a lifetime of hidebound norms.Pak (Tai Bo) and Hoi (Ben Yuen) keep their rendezvous a secret while affectionately fulfilling their duties as fathers and grandfathers. (The film’s original title, “Suk Suk,” is a Cantonese term for older men, or “uncles.”) Instead of pushing for a grand tragic romance, the writer-director, Ray Yeung, lingers on moments of domestic warmth in the men’s lives: whether shopping at the market for a meal at Hoi’s apartment, or separately catching up with their extended families over supper.
