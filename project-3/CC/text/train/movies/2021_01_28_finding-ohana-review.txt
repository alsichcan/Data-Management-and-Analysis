‘Finding Ohana’ Review: Treasure Hunting and Family Healing
The Hawaiian term ohana, which means family, may be most recognized from its popularization by the Disney animated film “Lilo and Stitch.” Like that alien-populated coming-of-age comedy, the Netflix film “Finding Ohana” uncovers adventure in the midst of familial dysfunction. But the treasure-hunting escapade at the center of this film weakens a more compelling look at the dynamics of a family and the uncertain future of its cultural legacy.Frequently at odds, the gregarious Pili (Kea Peahu) and her cooler-than-thou brother Ioane (Alex Aiono) are none too happy to be uprooted from their Brooklyn lives. Their widowed mother, Leilani (Kelly Hu), moves them to her Wi-Fi-free childhood home on Oahu to take care of her father (Branscombe Richmond). Restless in their new surroundings, the teens (along with their new friends) occupy their time by chasing after an ancient treasure hidden in a cave on the island.
